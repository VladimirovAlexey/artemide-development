\section{General structure and user input of \texttt{artemide}}

\subsection{General concept}

The \texttt{artemide} is a package of Fortran modules for calculation in TMD factorization framework. It is has a modular structure, where each module is responsible for evaluation of some theory construct. For instance: a TMD distribution, a TMD evolution factor, cross-section. Each module produces a single function, which is a composite of integrals/products of lower-level functions. Thus, each level of operation can be used as is, in other programs. The highest-level task is the evaluation of cross-section within the TMD factorization theorem, including all needed integrations, and factors, i.e., such that it can be directly compared to the data. It also includes several tools for analysis of the obtained values, such as variation of scales, search for limiting parameters, etc. The theory structure of \texttt{artemide} is discussed in the next section. The dependency structure of modules is presented in fig.\ref{fig:dependencies}.

Initially the \texttt{artemide} project was created for pure theoretical games. Since the beginning \texttt{artemide} appears to be successful also in the phenomenology, (and nowadays it is mostly used for it). Nonetheless, conceptually \texttt{artemide} is build as the theory playground, and will continue to be developed in this direction.  That is why it architecture is not very optimal from the pure numerical point of view. In fact, there are several ways to optimize the code, melting together some modules and structures, but in this case \texttt{artemide} will lose it theoretical cleanness. Also \texttt{artemide} contains a lot of ``unpractical'' and rare options, and possibility to control each parameter. The positive side is the possibility to easily implement the new theory founding and check them, which is regularly done.

\textbf{Wide spectrum of application of \texttt{artemide} code makes it difficult to create a convenient interface.} Moreover, at the current stage of development, I prioritize the quality of computation, to the user interface. So, the interface is changing from version to version and often is not compatible with earlier versions. It slowly converges to the (almost) perfect shape -- convenient for a wider community. If you have a particular task and not sure how to operate with \texttt{artemide} in this case, better write an e-mail.

\begin{tcolorbox}
\textbf{The main rule} (implemented in ver.2.00) each part encapsulates its theory parameters. It does not affect/change/interact with other modules, except requests for functions. A change of a parameter in a module can require a change in another module for consistency (however, I attempt to avoid such cases). Then each parameter must be changed individually in each module. However, the module \texttt{aTMDe\_control} does it automatically. So, I suggest to use \texttt{aTMDe\_control} to avoid possible inconsistencies.
\end{tcolorbox}
\textbf{Historical note:} In versions before ver.2.00 this rule was not implemented. I tried to make connections between modules such that they automatically control consistency. However, at some moment (after inclusion of many hadrons and different types of cross-sections, and different orders) it became practically tough to keep such a system. So, I rearrange some modules (e.g. variation of $c_4$ scale was in \texttt{TMDs}, while it related to definition of TMD it-self), removed connections between modules (no link for change of NP parameters, etc.), and introduce \texttt{aTMDe\_control}.

\subsection{Organization of TMD factorized cross-section and its implementation in \texttt{artemide}}

The ultimate goal of the \texttt{artemide} is to evaluate the observables in the TMD factorization framework, such as cross-section, asymmetries, etc. The general structure of the TMD factorized \textit{fully differential} cross-section  is
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{d\sigma}{dX}=
d\sigma(q_T)=prefactor~\times F,
\end{eqnarray}
where 
$prefactor$ a process-dependent and experiment-dependent prefactor, and $F$ is the reduced structure function. Example, for the photon induced Drell-Yan process one has for $d\sigma/dq_T$
\begin{eqnarray*}
prefactor&=&\frac{4\pi}{9sQ^2}|C_V(Q,\mu_H)|^2 \mathcal{P}(\text{cuts}),
\\
F&=&\int \frac{bdb}{2}J_0(bq_T)\sum_{f}|e_f|^2F_{f}(x_A,b;\mu_H,\zeta_A)F_{\bar f}(x_B,b;\mu_H,\zeta_B),
\end{eqnarray*}
where $\mathcal{P}(\text{cuts})$ is the weighting factor for fiducial cuts. For specific expression we refer in corresponding sections of this text. The structure function $F$ is generally defined as
\begin{eqnarray}
F(q_T,x_1,x_2;\mu,\zeta_1,\zeta_2)=\int \frac{b db}{2}b^{n}J_n(b q_T)\sum_{ff'} z_{ff'} F^f_1(x_1,b;\mu,\zeta_1)F^{f'}_2(x_2,b;\mu,\zeta_2),
\end{eqnarray}
where $F_{1,2}$ are TMD distributions (of any origin and polarization), $z_{ff'}$ is the process dependent flavor mixing factor. The number $n$ is also process dependent, e.g. for unpolarized observables it is $n=0$, while for SSA's it is $n=1$. Evaluation structure functions $F$ is performed in the module \texttt{TMDF}. The evaluation of cross-sections is performed in the modules \texttt{TMDX}. The TMD distributions are evaluated by the module \texttt{TMDs} and related submodules.

\begin{tcolorbox}
In this way, the computation of TMD-factorized cross-section can be naturally split into ordered parts. Each part is evaluated in corresponding module of \texttt{artemide}. See example, of evaluation scheme in fig.\ref{fig:order_of_evaluation}.
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{User defined functions and options}

\begin{tcolorbox}
The \texttt{artemide} package has been created such that it allows to control \textbf{each aspect} of TMD factorization theorem. The TMD factorization has a large number of free, and ``almost-free'' parameters. It is a generally difficult task to provide a convenient interface for all these inputs. I do my best to make the interface convenient; however, some parts (e.g., setup of $f_{NP}$) could not be simpler (at least within FORTRAN). Also, take care that \texttt{artemide} is evolving, and I try to keep back compatibility, but it is not the main option.
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}
Starting from ver.2.0, \texttt{artemide} uses the text initialization file, which contains all required information on static parameters for a given setup. Throughout the text I call this file \texttt{constants-file}.
\end{tcolorbox}

The user has to provide (or \textbf{use the default values}) the set of parameters, that control various aspects of evaluation. It includes PDF sets, $f_{NP}$, perturbative scales, parameters of numerics, non-QCD inputs, etc.  There are three input sources for statical parameters.

\begin{itemize}
\item[~] \textbf{General parameters:} These are working parameters of \texttt{artemide}, such as amount of output, tolerance of integration routines, number of NP parameters, type of used evolution, griding parameters, triggering of particular contributions, etc. There are many of them, and typically they are unchanged. These are set in \texttt{constants-file}. \textbf{Changes do not require recompilation.}
\item[~] \textbf{External physics input:} It includes the definition of $\alpha_s$, collinear PDFs, and other distributions. Twist-2 distributions are taken from LHAPDF \cite{Buckley:2014ana}, with routines defined in \text{QCDinput} module. For non-QCD parameters, e.g. $\alpha_{QED}$, SM parameters, there is a module \texttt{EWinput}. These are set in \texttt{constants-file}. \textbf{Changes do not require recompilation.}
\item[~] \textbf{NP model:} The NP model consists in NP profiles of TMD distributions, NP model for large-b evolution, selection of scales $\mu$, etc. These parameter and functions enter nearly each low level module. The code for corresponding functions is provided by user, in appropriate files, which are collected in the subdirectory \texttt{src/Model}. The name of files are shown on diagram in colored blobs adjusted to the related module. \red{\textbf{Changes require recompilation.}}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Comments:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{IMPORTANT:} Each module is initialized individually via \texttt{constants-file}. So, each module can be used independently on the full package, given proper section of \texttt{constants-file} and submodules (see diagram). However, unless you understand what is going on, it is recommended to use \texttt{aTMDe\_setup} module for  creation of \texttt{constant-file}, and \texttt{aTMDe\_control} module for proper control, initialization and operations of sub-modules.
\item \texttt{constants-file} can be saved and used in future to reproduce setup. I try to keep compatibility between these files.
\item \texttt{constants-file} is created and modified within \texttt{aTMDe\_setup} module. It could be also modified manually.
\item NP functions are typically defined with a number of numeric parameters. The value of these parameters could be changed without restart (or recompilation) of the \texttt{artemide} by appropriate command. E.g. (\texttt{call TMDs{\_}SetNPParameters(lambda)}) on the level of \texttt{TMDs} module. See sections of corresponding modules.
\item The number of parameters in the model for each module is set in \texttt{constants-file}.
\item The directory \texttt{/Model} together with \texttt{constants-file} are convenient to keep as they are. They contain full information about particular evaluation, and thus results can be always reproduced (at least within the same version of \texttt{artemide}). I provide results of our extraction as such directories. 
\item Before ver.2.0, the interface was different and chaotic.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Installation}

Download and unpack \texttt{artemide}. The actual code is in the /src. Check the \texttt{makefile}. \red{\textbf{You must provide options \texttt{FC} and \texttt{FOPT}, which are defined in the top of it.}} \texttt{FC} is the FORTRAN compiler, \texttt{FOPT} is additional options for compiler (e.g. linking to LHAPDF library).

There is no actual installation procedure, there is just compilation. If model, inputs, etc, are set correctly (typical problem is linking to LHAPDF, be sure that it is installed correctly), then \texttt{make} compiles the library. The result are object files (\texttt{*.o}) (which are collected in \texttt{/obj}) and module files (\texttt{*.mod}) (which are collected in \texttt{/mod}). 

The test of current compilation could be performed by \texttt{make test}. It compiles program \texttt{test.f90} from /Prog and run it (default test uses \texttt{NPDF31\_nnlo\_as\_0118} set from LHAPDF, check that it is present in your LHAPDF installation). Program \texttt{test} runs some elementary code with minimum input. Output is shown later

Next, do your code, \texttt{include} appropriate modules of \texttt{artemide}, and compile it together with object-files (do not forget to add proper references to module files \texttt{-I/mod}). It should work! Linking could be done automatically if you call for \texttt{make program TARGET=...}, where ... is the name of the file with the code.

\subsection{Python interface: \texttt{harpy}}

For simplicity of data analysis the \texttt{artemide} has a python interface, called \texttt{harpy} (linking is made by f2py library). It is not possible to interfacing the \texttt{artemide} directly  to python since \texttt{artemide} is made on fortran95. \texttt{Artemide} uses some features of Fortran95, such as interfaces, and indirect list declarations, which are alien to python. Also I have not found any convenient way to include several dependent Fortran modules in f2py (if you have suggestion just tell me). Therefore, I made a wrap module \texttt{harpy.f90} that call some useful functions from \texttt{artemide} with simple declarations. It contains limited set of functions useful for phenomenology, and definitely cannot replace the FORTRAN interface for deep studies.

The compilation of \texttt{harpy} is slightly more complicated.

\begin{enumerate}
\item In the makefile check the variable \texttt{Fpath} (in the top part of the file). Put-in the full path for fortran compiler. It is needed by f2py.
\item (optional, does not work on Mac (?)) Run \texttt{make harpy-signature} . This will create an interface file (\texttt{artemide.pyf} for all functions in the \texttt{harpy.f90}. This file is already provided in the distribution, so if you did not change \texttt{harpy.f90}, you better skip this step. For some reason, it does not work on Mac.
\item Run \texttt{make harpy}. It compiles \texttt{harpy.f90} with interface \texttt{artemide.pyf} linking to \texttt{artemide}. The result is \texttt{artemide.so}.
\end{enumerate}

All files are in /harpy. Link it to python and work. There is also extra python \texttt{harpy.py} which has several most important function.

\subsection{Constants file and version compatibility}

Constants files contains the list of work-flow parameters, such as physical constants, LHA grid names, numerical setup, etc. Each constants file has version number (does not coincide with the version of artemide). 

On the module initialization the constants file is read, parameter are setup. Thus, the version of constants file should be adjusted to version of artemide \textit{if you run modules separately}.

The workflow is deferent of the initialization of \texttt{artemide} is made by the \texttt{artemide\_control}. In this case, the \texttt{artemide} creates a copy of the initial constants-file (\texttt{aTMDe\_temporary}), and (in the case the versions do not match) fill the absent options by default parameter. After it the lower-level modules are initialized by \texttt{aTMDe\_temporary}. Naturally, in this case the versions should match (if not something is wrong with installation).

\begin{tcolorbox}
You can update the \texttt{constants-file} to an actual version by 
\\
\texttt{make update TARGET=...}
\\
where ... is the path to \texttt{constants-file} to be updated. The updated version will have all content of the original file, + new options setup by default setting.

\subsection{Passing non-perturbative parameters}
\label{control:NPparam}

The important part of the initialization is the number of NP parameters for each TMD distributions under consideration. Each TMD-evaluating module (say, \texttt{uTMDPDF}, \texttt{uTMDFF}, etc.) requires $n_i$ number of parameters. The numbers are specified in \texttt{constants-file}. The number must be greater then zero $n_i>0$ for any used module, i.e. $f_{NP}$ is at least 1-parametric (if it is not so, just do not use the parameter in the definition of $f_{NP}$, but keep $n_i>0$). These numbers are read during the initialization procedure, and allocate the memory. 

The set of particular values of these parameters can be done by several ways.

\textbf{Option I: } Set all values in a single call

\texttt{call artemide{\_}SetNPParameters(lambda)}

where 
\begin{itemize}
\item[$\{\lambda_i\}$] real*8(1:$\sum_i n_i$ ) The set of parameters which define the non-perturbative functions $f_{NP}$ within modules. It is split into parts and send to corresponding modules. I.e. lambda(1:$n_0$) $\to$\texttt{uTMDR}, lambda($n_0+1$:$n_0+n_1$) $\to$\texttt{uTMDPDF},  lambda($n_0+n_1+1$:$n_0+n_1+n_2$) $\to$\texttt{uTMDFF} (fixed order). 
\end{itemize}

~

\textbf{Option II: } Set value for particular function. For it call \texttt{artemide\_SetNPparameters\_???(lambdaNP)}, where \texttt{???} is module name, e.g.

\texttt{\texttt{artemide\_SetNPparameters\_uTMDPDF(lambdaNP)}}

will set parameters for unpolarized TMDPDF.

~

\textbf{Option III: } You can use presaved values of $\lambda_{NP}$ for a given function. They are provided by model file (if provided). To set NP-input given by integer \texttt{num}, call \texttt{artemide\_SetReplica\_???(num)}, where \texttt{???} is module name, e.g.

\texttt{\texttt{artemide\_SetReplica\_uTMDPDF(num)}}

will set parameters for unpolarized TMDPDF.

\section{\texttt{QCDinput} module}
\label{QCDinput}

The module \texttt{QCDinput} gives an interface to external function provided by the user, such as PDF, FF, values of alpha-strong. By default the input for these functions is done via the LHAPDF tables. Originally, artemide used the LHAPDF library \cite{Buckley:2014ana}, which however caused a number of inconveniences, such as difficulty in the installation, problems with simultaneous usage of many tables, and parallel access to the tables. Starting from the version 3.01 artemide is detached from the LHAPDF library, but continue to relay on LHAPDF-tables as input for the QCD parameters. The tables are read and interpolated by the original artemide sub-modules (\texttt{LHA\_alpha} and \texttt{LHA\_PDF}). The details on these modules are presented below.


\begin{tcolorbox}
For the technical reasons there is a \red{\textbf{hard-coded limit for the maximum number of hadrons}}. This limit can be changed but it requires modification of the code. The default limitation is the following: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{uPDF} 3 hadrons, 
\item \texttt{uFF} 6 hadrons, 
\item \texttt{lpPDF} 1 hadron,
\item \texttt{gPDF} 2 hadrons (helicity PDFs), 
\item \texttt{hPDF} 2 hadrons (transversity PDFs).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Initialization}
\label{sec:QCDinput_ini}

\red{TOBE WRITTEN}

\subsection{\texttt{LHA\_alpha} module}

The module reads the info-file of the LHAPDF set and extracts the information about $\alpha_s$. For the moment the only possible input is with "\texttt{AlphaS\_Type=ipol}". The interpolation is done by cubic-interpolation in logarithm scale, for each mass-threshold subgrid (in accordance of the description of LHAPDF library). Compared that the deviation from the original LHA library and \texttt{artemide} is better that $10^{-6}$ (i.e. at the level of float-definition fluctuations).

Below the $Q_{\text{min}}$ I perform the extrapolation by the following formula
\begin{eqnarray}
\alpha_s(Q)=\frac{\alpha_0 \alpha_1 \ln(Q_1/Q_0)}{(\alpha_0-\alpha_1)\ln(Q/Q_0)+\alpha_1\ln(Q_1/Q_0)},
\end{eqnarray}
where $Q_0=Q_{\text{min}}$ and $Q_1$ is the next-to-$Q_{\min}$ node, and $\alpha_{0,1}=\alpha_s(Q_{0,1})$. This formula extrapolate $1/\alpha$ logarithmically in the logarithm scale. It gives the values of $\Lambda_{\text{eff}}$
\begin{eqnarray}
\Lambda_{\text{eff}}=Q_0\exp\(-\frac{\alpha_1 \ln(Q_1/Q_0)}{\alpha_0-\alpha_1}\),
\end{eqnarray}
where the coupling constant diverges. The minimal possible $Q$ is truncated to $\text{min}(0.4\text{GeV},\Lambda_{\text{eff}}+0.1\text{GeV})$ to avoid problems with low energy.

\subsection{\texttt{LHA\_PDF} module}

The module reads info-file and the PDF-table and interpolates using the log-qubic interpolation (instead of cubic-Hermite interpolator from LHAPDF-library). There is a small-difference between interpolating results but they are smaller that $10^{-4}$ (relative). I.e. far inside of the pdf uncertainties. 

Below the $Q_{\text{min}}=Q_0$ the extrapolation is done by the formula
\begin{eqnarray}
F(x,Q)=F(x,Q_0) (Q/Q_0)^{\Gamma(Q)},\qquad \Gamma(Q)=2+\sqrt{\frac{Q}{Q_0}}(\gamma(x)-2),
\end{eqnarray}
where $F(x,Q)=xf(x,Q)$, and $\gamma(x)$ is 
\begin{eqnarray}
\gamma(x)=\frac{\ln F(Q_1)-\ln F(Q_0)}{\ln(Q_1/Q_0)}\approx \frac{d \ln F(Q)}{d\ln Q}.
\end{eqnarray}
This is in the agreement of formulas (4,5) of ref.\cite{Buckley:2014ana}. Below $0.4$GeV the extrapolation terminated and error is called.

\newpage
\section{\texttt{EWinput} module}
\label{EWinput}

\texttt{EWinput} module contains definitions of various physical parameters of elector-weak interactions, such as masses of Z and W bosons, CKM matrix, code for evolution of $\alpha_{QED}$ etc.

\red{TOBE WRITTEN}

\subsection{$\alpha_{\text{QED}}$}

\textbf{This implementation has been added in ver.2.03. In earlier versions the code for $\alpha_{\text{QED}}$ had a bug that generated slightly lower values (independently on the values of $\mu$).}

The QED coupling constant is set by the one-loop QED evolution with LO matching at thresholds. In order to tune it finer, the value of $\beta_0$ is modified by $\beta_0\to \beta_0+\delta \beta$, where $\delta \beta$ is found by exact implementation of two boundary values, $\alpha_{\text{QED}}(m_\tau)$ and $\alpha_{\text{QED}}(m_Z)$. 

The LO evolution is
\begin{eqnarray}
\alpha(\mu)=\frac{1}{\alpha_0^{-1}+2\beta_0 \ln(\mu/\mu_0)},
\end{eqnarray}
where $\beta_0=-(3\pi)^{-1}N_{eff}$ with 
\begin{eqnarray}
N_{eff}=\sum_{\substack{\text{active}\\\text{ leptons}}}1+N_c\sum_{\substack{\text{active}\\\text{quarks}}}e_q^2.
\end{eqnarray}
In artemide I account the following threasholds
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c||c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
$\mu$   & $\mu<m_e(\sim m_u,m_d)$ & $\mu<m_\mu(\sim m_s)$ & ~$\mu<m_c$~ & ~$\mu<m_\tau$~ & ~$\mu<m_b$~ & ~$\mu<m_t$~ & $\mu>m_t$
\\\hline
$N_{eff}$& 0 & $\frac{8}{3}$ & $4$ & $\frac{16}{3}$ & $\frac{19}{3}$ & $\frac{20}{3}$ & $8$ 
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
So the actual formula for $\alpha_{QED}$ is
\begin{eqnarray}
\alpha_{\text{QED}}(\mu)=\frac{1}{\alpha_Z^{-1}+2\bar \beta\[N_{eff}(\mu)\ln\(\frac{\mu}{m_{th}}\)+\sum_{m_i\in m_{th}} N_{eff}\ln\(\frac{m_{i}}{m_{i+1}}\)\]},
\end{eqnarray}
where $m_{th}$ are all threasholds from $\mu$ till $M_Z$. The constant $\bar \beta$ is defined by exact matching at $M_Z$ and $m_\tau$. For default values $\bar\beta/\beta_0\sim 1.002\%$, so it accounts for really tiny effects.

\newpage

\section{TMD evolution modules}

The TMD evolution has several implementation. The artemide v3 (and higher) is hard-coded to use the fixed-$\mu$ evolution (see ref.\cite{Scimemi:2018xaf}). This choice is made after many test performed in earlier versions or artemide (where the type of evolution was selected by user), and the demonstration that they are equivalent within perturbative uncertainty.

The fixed-$\mu$ scale corresponds to evolution along $\zeta$ is with fixed-$\mu$ solution to the special equi-potential line, and evolution along $\mu$ along equi-potential line (this part is unity by definition). The evolution factor reads
\begin{eqnarray}
R[b,(\mu_1,\zeta_1)\to(\mu_2,\zeta_2)]&=&\frac{R[b,(\mu_1,\zeta_1)\to(\mu_1,\zeta_{\mu_1})]}{R[b,(\mu_2,\zeta_2)\to(\mu_2,\zeta_{\mu_2})]},
\\
R[b,(\mu,\zeta)\to(\mu,\zeta_{\mu})]&=&\exp\(-\mathcal{D}(\mu,b)\ln\(\frac{\zeta}{\zeta_\mu(b)}\)\),
\end{eqnarray}
where $\mathcal{D}$ is the Collins-Soper kernel, and $\zeta_\mu(b)$ is the special $\zeta$-line.

The Collins-Soper kernel is defined as
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathcal{D}^f(\mu,b)=\mathcal{D}^f_{\text{pert}}(\mu_{\text{OPE}},b)+\int_{\mu_{\text{OPE}}}^{\mu} \frac{d\mu'}{\mu'}\Gamma^f(\mu')+\mathcal{D}^f_{\text{NP}}(b),
\end{eqnarray}
where $\mathcal{D}^f_{\text{pert}}$ is the high-scale perturbative part, and $\mathcal{D}_{\text{NP}}$ is the non-perturbative model (e.g. $g_Kb^2$)

The module for evolution includes three modules
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{TMD\_AD} this module contains collection of all anomalous dimensions and related quantities. Logically it is equivalent to \texttt{\_OPE} modules.
\item \texttt{TMDR\_model} this module contains the user-defined non-perturbative input.
\item \texttt{TMDR} this module interface \texttt{TMD\_AD} and \texttt{TMDR\_model} into the evolution factor, and perform the general control.
\end{itemize}
The initialization is happened thorough the \texttt{TMDR}-module.

At small values of parameter $Q=Q_0$ the point $(Q,Q^2)$ crosses the $\zeta$-lines. The value of $Q_0$ depends on $b$. The dangerous situation is then hard scale of the process $Q$ is smaller then $Q_0$ at large $b=b_\infty$. In this case the evolution kernel $R[b_\infty,(Q,Q^2)\to \zeta_\mu]>1$, which is generally implies that it grows to infinity. However, it happens only at small values of $Q$. E.g. at NNLO the typical value of $Q_0$ is $\sim 1.5$GeV. That should be taken into account during consideration of low-energy experiment and especially their error-band, since the point $(c_2Q,Q^2)$ could cross the point at larger values of $Q$.

The function \texttt{LowestQ()} returns the values (real*8(1:3)) $\{Q_{-1},Q_0,Q_{+1}\}$, which are solution of equation $Q^2=\zeta_{c Q}(b)$, for (fixed bu) large values of $b$. $Q_{-1}$ corresponds to $c=0.5$, $Q_0$ corresponds to $c=1$ and $Q_{+1}$ corresponds to $c=2$.

\begin{itemize}
\item[*] $\mathcal{D}_{\text{resum}}$ starts from $a_s^0$, it already contains $\Gamma_0$.
\item[**] Definition of $\zeta_\mu$ is correct only in the natural ordering, i.e. \texttt{LO},\texttt{NLO},\texttt{NNLO}. Proper definition in \texttt{+} orders would make the function too heavy. The resumed version has the same counting.
\item[***] The finite part =0, since $d^{(5,0)}$ is unknown.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Notes:}
\begin{itemize}
\item For very small-values of $b$ the value of $b$ is fixed.
\item For very large positive values of $\mathcal{D}$ (i.e. for $b>25$GeV$^{-1}$ or so), the exact solution for $\zeta$-line diverges exponentially at 3- and 4- loops. It is because the coefficient infront of rising terms is negative. To prevent the divergence, the corresponding terms are expanded in $a_s$ up to needed power ($\alpha_s^6$).

\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\textbf{Notes:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The integral over $\mu$ is done using exact analytical formula by decomposition of $\beta$-function over roots. 
\item The exact expression for $\zeta$-line is numerically unstable at very small-$b$. It is due to its double-exponential nature which requires exponentiation and cancellation of large-numbers. However, it could be computed analytically in this regime as expansion. Thus, to stabilize the computation of expression the following formula is used
\begin{eqnarray}
\zeta_\mu = e^{-b^2/S}\zeta_\text{pert}+(1-e^{-b^2/S})\zeta_\text{exact}.
\end{eqnarray}
Here, $S$ is the smoothing parameter. It should be small enough to guaranty non-impact of approximation (approx. $S<0.05$).

\section{Modules computing TMD distributions}

There are many TMD distributions each computed in a separate module. All TMD distributions are split in the following classes:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Pure Twist-2 OPE} These are \texttt{uTMDPDF}, \texttt{uTMDFF}, \texttt{lpTMDPDF}. These TMD distributions are defined by twist-2 collinear distribution at small-b
\item \textbf{Pure Twist-3 OPE} These are \texttt{SiversTMDPDF}, \texttt{BoerMuldersTMDPDF}. These TMD distributions are defined by twist-3 collinear distribution at small-b
\item \textbf{Twist-2 \& Twist-3 OPE} These are \texttt{wgtTMDPDF}, \texttt{wglTMDPDF}. These TMD distributions are defined by twist-2 (WW-term) and twist-3 collinear distribution at small-b
\item \textbf{Pure-parton TMDs} These are \texttt{eeTMDFF}. These TMD distributions are defined by a pure parton (i.e. jet), and thus their small-b expansion is just a number (i.e. does not contain any hadron matrix elements).
\end{itemize}
These lists are to be extended in the future. 

Each module consists of several sub-modules, which have names as \texttt{TMDname\_X}. The \texttt{X} corresponds to
\begin{itemize}
\item  \texttt{OPE} this module computes the convolution of the twist-2 (or twist-3) coefficient function with corresponding PDF.
\item \texttt{model} this module contains all information about NP-part and other free-parameters (such as $\mu_{\text{OPE}}$ of the given TMD distribution. \textbf{\blue{These modules could be edited by user, to implement/update/fit TMDs.}}
\end{itemize}

The most part of modules are identical. There are a few differences in the implementation. So, first the general structure is presented, and then particularities.

Different OPE's are known up to different orders. Consequently, the modules implement them at different orders. The orders are denoted as
\begin{eqnarray*}
\texttt{NA}&:\to & \text{no OPE}
\\
\texttt{LO}&:\to & C=\mathcal{O}(a_s^0)
\\
\texttt{NLO}&:\to & C=\mathcal{O}(a_s^1)
\\
\texttt{NNLO}=\texttt{N2LO}&:\to & C=\mathcal{O}(a_s^2)
\\
\texttt{NNNLO}=\texttt{N3LO}&:\to & C=\mathcal{O}(a_s^3).
\end{eqnarray*}
\begin{itemize}
\item The \texttt{NA} option is used to remove any relation to collinear distributions. In this case $TMD(x,b)=f_{\text{NP}}(x,b)$
\item If the coefficient function at LO/NLO/.. is zero, the convolution is also zero. E.g. linearly polarized gluons start at $\sim a_s$, the convolution is zero at \texttt{LO}. 
\end{itemize}
\begin{center}
List of available orders for different distributions

\begin{eqnarray*}
\texttt{uTMDPDF}&:& \texttt{NA, LO, NLO, N2LO, N3LO}

The functions are computed by the following rule
\begin{eqnarray}
\texttt{uTMDPDF}&=&[C\times f]_{\text{tw2}}(x,b)F_{\text{NP}}(x,b),
\\
\texttt{uTMDFF}&=&[C\times d]_{\text{tw2}}(x,b)F_{\text{NP}}(x,b),

where $f$ (\texttt{uPDF}), $d$ (\texttt{uFF}), $f_{\text{lp}}$ (\texttt{lpPDF}) $g$ (\texttt{gPDF}), $h$ (\texttt{hPDF}) are collinear distributions of twist-2 (taken from corresponding module), and $[C\times h]_{\text{tw2}}$ is corresponding convolution;
$T$ and $E$ are collinear distributions of twist-3, and $[C\times T]_{\text{tw3}}$, $[C\times E]_{\text{tw3}}$ are corresponding convolution; $F_{\text{NP}}(x,b)$ and $F^{\text{tw3}}_{\text{NP}}(x,b)$ are non-perturbative functions to be fit. NP functions are defined in the \texttt{XX\_model} modules, and share the same $\lambda_{\text{NP}}$ (array of parameters). This structure correctly reproduces the small-b properties of TMD-distributions. The convolutions are computed in separate modules see sec.\ref{TMD_OPE}, \ref{TMD_OPE_tw3}.

The modules computes the optimal TMDs, and also evolved TMDs. Generally a TMD distribution is given by the expression
\begin{eqnarray}\label{TMD:F=RF}
F_f(x,b;\mu,\zeta)=R_f[b,(\mu,\zeta)\to(\mu,\zeta_{\mu})]\tilde F_f(x,b),
\end{eqnarray}
where $R$ is the TMD evolution kernel, $\tilde F$ is an optimal TMD distribution.

\subsection{\texttt{\_OPE} modules (tw2)}
\label{TMD_OPE}

OPE modules compute the following convolution
\begin{eqnarray}\label{OPE:tw2:main}
[C\times f](x)&=&\int_x^1 \frac{dy}{y} C(y,\mathbf{L})f\(\frac{x}{y},\mu_{\text{OPE}}\)
\\
&=&
\frac{1}{x}\int_x^1 dy C(y,\mathbf{L})F\(\frac{x}{y},\mu_{\text{OPE}}\),
\end{eqnarray}
where $F(x)=xf(x)$ and 
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathbf{L}=\ln\(\frac{\mu^2_{\text{OPE}}b^2}{4e^{-2\gamma_E}}\).
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{tcolorbox}
\begin{center}
OPE modules are initialized automatically from the corresponding TMD module. 
\end{center}
\end{tcolorbox}

\textbf{Extra notes:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{eeTMDFF} does not have \texttt{\_OPE} sub-module, because its OPE is elementary, and written directly in the main code.
\item The convolution is convergent, but the convolution kernel has singularity at $y\to1$. To stabilize the integral, it is computed as
\begin{eqnarray}
\int_x^1 dy (...)=\int_x^{y_C} dy (...)+\int_{y_C}^1 dy (...).
\end{eqnarray}
The first term is computed by the adaptive algorithm. The second term is computed by the approximate formulas
\begin{eqnarray*}
&& \int_{y_C}^1 dy \frac{f(x/y)-f(x)}{1-y}=f(x/y_C)-f(x),
\\
&&\int_{y_C}^1 dy \frac{f(x/y)-f(x)}{1-y}\ln(1-y)=(f(x/y_C)-f(x))(\ln(1-y_C)-1),
\\
&&\int_{y_C}^1 dy \frac{f(x/y)-f(x)}{1-y}\ln^2(1-y)=(f(x/y_C)-f(x))(2-\ln(1-y_C)+2\ln^2(1-y_C)),
\\
&& \int_{y_C}^1 dy f(x/y)g(y)=f(x)\int_{y_C}^1 dy g(y),
\end{eqnarray*}
where $g(y)$ is integrable, and the last integral is taken explicitly.
\item The parameter $y_C=1-10^{-4}$ (\textbf{\red{for a moment}}) is fixed. It provides the accuracy of the last integral (6-7 digits), which is far better than.
\item For $x\sim y_C$ the accuracy drops. In this case, the values of $y_C$ is recomputed by formula $y_C=(100+x)/101$ (i.e. it is 2-digits closer to 1 than $x$).
\item \textbf{The definition of TMDFF does not perfectly match the definition of collinear FF. There is a relative factor $1/z^2$.} So the convolution reads
\begin{eqnarray}
D(z,b)=\int_z^1 \frac{dy}{y}\mathbb{C}\(\frac{z}{y},\mathbf{L}_\mu\)\frac{d(y,\mu)}{y^2}=
\frac{1}{z^3}\int_z^1 dy [y^2C]\(y,\mathbf{L}_\mu\)D(\frac{z}{y},\mu),
\end{eqnarray}
where $D(z)=zd(z)$.

\subsubsection{Model parameters.} 

The OPE is fully deterministic formula, but it contains the free scale, and often one implement $b^*$-modification. These parameters are written in \texttt{model}-module. Namely:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{bSTAR(bT,x,y)} = is the function used instead of $b$ in  $\mathbf{L}$ in eqn.(\ref{OPE:tw2:main}).
\item \texttt{muOPE(bt,x,y,c4)} = is the function used for $\mu_{\text{OPE}}$.
\end{itemize}
In both cases, the variables $x$ and $y$ are defined as in eqn.(\ref{OPE:tw2:main}). The parameter $c_4$ is the scale variation parameter.

\subsubsection{Scale variation.} 

TO BE WRITTEN

\subsubsection{Grid}
\label{sec:OPE:grid1}

For fitting procedure one often needs to evaluate TMDs multiple times. For example, for fit performed in \cite{Scimemi:2017etj} the evaluation of singe $\chi^2$ entry requires $\sim 16\times 10^6$ calls of \texttt{uTMDPDF{\_}..}. So, every call of \texttt{uTMDPDF{\_}..} at NNLO order, requires $\sim 200$ calls of pdfs, depending on $x$, $b$ and $\lambda$'s, in order to evaluate the integral over $y$. In such situations, it is much faster to make a grid of TMD distributions for a given set of non-pertrubative parameters (i.e. the grid is in $x$ and $b$), and then use this grid for the interpolation of TMD values. The calculation of a grid is not a very fast procedure, nonetheless, for large computation (number of TMD calls $>10^4-10^5$) is more efficient.

The grid used in the artemide 3.0 is Chebyschev grid similar to the one described in [2112.09703]. Along each direction the phase-space is split into subgrids
$[x_0,x_1,...,x_{n}]$ ($x_n=1$) and $[b_0,b_1,...,b_k]$. Within each subgrid there some amount of node, distributed as $\ln(x)$ and $\ln(b)$ over Chebyschev points. The interpolation is done by barycentric formula.
\begin{itemize}
\item For $x<x_0$ and $x>1$ the error is returned.
\item For $b<b_0$ and $b>b_k$ the value at $b_0$ or $b_k$ is returned.
\end{itemize}
All these parameters can be changed in \texttt{constants} file.  However, we recommend to use default values, since they were checked. The check could be performed by the call \texttt{TestGrid()} subroutine of corresponding module. It computes values for central points of grids-cells from grid and from direct computation. This check can be also called by option in the \texttt{constants} file.

\begin{tcolorbox}
\begin{center}
\textbf{\red{WARNING!}}
\\
LHAPDF produces the non-smooth interpolation (based on cubic splines), while the Chebychev interpolation is much smoother. Therefore, at some points the difference between Chebyshev and LHAPDF can the significant (up to $50\%$ and more if absolute value of function is small). Practically, one cannot push avarage precision better than $10^{-4}$. In a bulk, it is acceptable. If the grid is tested at smooth input function one can easily reach precision $\sim 10^{-8}$.

\subsubsection{Technical notes}
\label{sec:technicalNote_1}

\begin{center}
\textbf{Convolution}
\end{center}

The convolution integral reads
\begin{eqnarray}
I(x)=\int_x^1 \frac{dz}{z}C(z)f\(\frac{x}{z}\)f_{NP}(x,z),
\end{eqnarray}
where the function $C(z)$ has a general form
\begin{eqnarray}
C(z)=C_0 \delta(1-z)+\(C_1(z)\)_++C_2(z).
\end{eqnarray}
Here the plus-distribution is undestood in the usual way
\begin{eqnarray}
\(C_1(z)\)_+=C_1(z)-\delta(1-z)\int_0^1 dy C_1(y)dy.
\end{eqnarray}
In NNLO coefficient function there are only possible two $(..)_+$ terms, $1/(1-z)$ and $\ln(1-z)/(1-z)$.

In order to simplify the integration we rewrite
\begin{eqnarray}
I(x)=\frac{1}{x}\int_x^1 dz C(z)\tilde f\(\frac{x}{z}\)f_{NP}(x,z),\qquad \tilde f(z)=zf(z).
\end{eqnarray}
Then the integral is split as
\begin{eqnarray}
I(x)=\frac{1}{x}\Big\{I_2(x)+C_0\tilde f\(x\)f_{NP}(x,1)+\tilde f\(x\)f_{NP}(x,1)\int_0^x dz C_1(z)\Big\},
\end{eqnarray}
where
\begin{eqnarray}
I_2(x)=\int_x^1 dz \Big[C_1(z)\(\tilde f\(\frac{x}{z}\)f_{NP}(x,z)-\tilde f\(x\)f_{NP}(x,1)\)+C_1(z)\tilde f\(\frac{x}{z}\)f_{NP}(x,z)\Big]
\end{eqnarray}
Presumably, the term $\sim C_0$ give the dominant contribution $w$, since it is $\sim 1$ whereas the other terms $\sim a_s$. Therefore, it serves as the estimation of the integral value, with respect to which the integration convergence is calculated. The convolution integral is evaluated by the G7K15 rule adaptively with given tolerance with respect to $w$. 

The integral $I$ is calculated in the procedure \texttt{Common\_lowScale50} and \texttt{Common\_lowScale5}, which is common for all twist-2 terms. The integral $I_2$ is calculated in the iterative procedures \texttt{MellinConvolutionVectorPart50} and \texttt{MellinConvolutionVectorPart5}, which is common for all twist-2 terms. 

\textbf{In the case of TMDFF} we have the coefficient function with the structure $C(z)/z^2$ (plus-distribution, $\delta$, etc, are multiplied by $1/z^2$), and collinear function $f(z)/z^2$. In this case it is convenient to rewrite
\begin{eqnarray}
I(x)=\int_x^1 \frac{dz}{z}\frac{C(z)}{z^2}\frac{f\(\frac{x}{z}\)}{(x/z)^2}f_{NP}(x,z)=\frac{1}{x^3}\int_x^1 dz C(z)\hat f\(\frac{x}{z}\)f_{NP}(x,z),\qquad \hat f(z)=zf(z).
\end{eqnarray}
Since the common-code calculates the integral PDF-like convolution, I divide by factor $1/x^2$ all output of the common-code.

\begin{center}
\textbf{Coefficient functions}
\end{center}

The coefficient function is spit to 6 terms.
\begin{eqnarray}
C_{q\ot q},\quad C_{q\ot g},\quad C_{g\ot q},\quad C_{g\ot g},\quad C_{q\ot \bar q},\quad C_{q\ot \bar q},\quad C_{q\ot q'},
\end{eqnarray}
where $C_{q\ot q}$ and $C_{q\ot \bar q}$ contain \textit{non-singlet} part only. The singlet contribution is given in $C_{q\ot q'}$. So, the convolution for a quark (e.g. $q=u$) reads
\begin{eqnarray}
F_u=C_{q\ot q}\otimes q_u+C_{q\ot g}\otimes q_g+C_{q\ot \bar q}\otimes q_{\bar u}+C_{q\ot q'}\otimes \sum_{f\in q,\bar q} q_f.
\end{eqnarray}
For gluon
\begin{eqnarray}
F_g=C_{g\ot g}\otimes q_g+C_{g\ot q}\otimes \sum_{f\in q,\bar q} q_f.
\end{eqnarray}

The kernels are split into regular, singular and $\delta$-parts, where singular contains $(\ln(1-x)/(1-x)))_+^n$ terms, $\delta$ contains only $\delta(1-x)$ terms, and regular is the rest. Singular and $\delta$-terms are present only for $C_{q\ot q}$ and $C_{g\ot g}$.

The regular part is decomposed further, into singular (but integrable) terms at $x\to0 $ and $x\to 1$, and the finite part. The singular terms are computed exactly, while the finite part is fitted to linear combination of several functions. The basis of fit is such that the expressions are exact for coefficients which do not contain PolyLog functions. These are NLO, leading log [at all orders], large-Nf [at all orders], and some others. The full basis for the regular part is
\begin{eqnarray}
&&\Big\{\underbrace{\ln \bar x,\ln^2\bar x,\ln^3\bar x,\ln^4\bar x,\ln^5\bar x,

\frac{\ln\bar x(1-x^2+2\ln x)}{1-x},
\frac{\bar x(\ln x+x)}{x}
\Big\}.
\end{eqnarray}
Decomposed in this basis the coefficient functions are very presice. The typical relative precision is $10^{-8}-10^{-10}$ \textit{for the finite part} (other terms are exact). The worst presicion happen at small $x\sim 10^{-5}$ for $g\ot g$ channel where relative precision is $\sim 10^{-5}-10^{-6}$.

Similar ansatz is used for uTMDFF, with some term removed (which are sensitive to small-x region). Precision in the case of TMDFF is slightly worse $10^{-6}-10^{-8}$. The worst precision is for N$^3$LO $q\to q'$ channel, where it is $\sim 10^{-4}-10^{-6}$. However, it is very good precision which guaranties about 10-12 presice digits for the physical convolution.

\textbf{Computation of AS$[\mathcal{X}_0]$}
\end{center}

The function AS$\mathcal{X}_0$ is defined in [2402.01836] and reads
\begin{eqnarray}\label{def:AS_X0}
\text{AS}[\mathcal{X}_0[F]]&=&\alpha_s \Big\{P_1+\alpha_s\[P_2+\(C_1-P_1\)\otimes\(P_1-\beta_0\)\]
\\\nn &&+\alpha_s^2\Big[P_3+\(C_1-P_1\)\otimes\(P_2-\beta_1\)
+\(C_2-P_2\)\otimes\(P_1-2\beta_0\)
\\\nn &&-\(C_1-P_1\)\otimes\(P_1-\beta_0\)\otimes\(P_1-2\beta_0\)\Big]
+\mathcal{O}\(\alpha_s^3\)\Big\}\otimes f.
\end{eqnarray}
I could be obtained by computation of ordinary optimal small-b convolution with replacement of finite terms by $0$, and logarithm terms by $\mathbf{L}_b^k\to -k!$. Thus, the function can be computed as ordinary convolution with the coefficient function $X$ defined as (up to N$^3$LO)
\begin{eqnarray}
X=\frac{3}{4}C[\mathbf{L}_b=0]-\frac{2}{3}C[\mathbf{L}_b=1]-\frac{1}{12}C[\mathbf{L}_b=4].
\end{eqnarray}



\subsection{\texttt{\_OPE} modules (tw3)}
\label{TMD_OPE_tw3}

OPE modules compute the following convolution
\begin{eqnarray}\label{OPE:tw3:main}
[C\times T](x)&=&\int [dy] C_{\text{tw3}}(y_{1,2,3}),\mathbf{L})T\(y_{1,2,3},\mu_{\text{OPE}}\),
\end{eqnarray}
where $T$ is a twist-three function (qgq-correlator) and
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathbf{L}=\ln\(\frac{\mu^2_{\text{OPE}}b^2}{4e^{-2\gamma_E}}\).
\end{eqnarray}

\subsubsection{Model parameters.} 

The OPE is fully deterministic formula, but it contains the free scale, and often one implement $b^*$-modification. These parameters are written in \texttt{model}-module. Namely:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{bSTAR(bT,x,y)} = is the function used instead of $b$ in  $\mathbf{L}$ in eqn.(\ref{OPE:tw2:main}).
\item \texttt{muOPE(bt,x,y,c4)} = is the function used for $\mu_{\text{OPE}}$.
\end{itemize}
In both cases, the variables $x$ and $y$ are defined as in eqn.(\ref{OPE:tw2:main}). The parameter $c_4$ is the scale variation parameter.

\subsection{Fourier to $k_T$ space}
\label{sec:Fourier_to_kt}

We define
\begin{eqnarray}
F(x,\vec k_T;\mu,\zeta)=\int \frac{d^2\vec b}{(2\pi)^2}F(x,\vec b;\mu,\zeta)e^{-i(\vec k_T \vec b)}.
\end{eqnarray}
Since all evaluated TMDs depends only on the modulus of $\vec b$, within the module we evaluate Hankel transformations. These transformations depends on the kind of TMD. Generally the integrals are
\begin{eqnarray}\label{kT-J0}
F(x,|\vec k_T|;\mu,\zeta)=\frac{M^{2n}}{n!}\int \frac{|b|d|\vec b|}{2\pi} \(\frac{|\vec  b|}{|k_T|}\)^{n} J_n(|\vec b||\vec k_T|) F(x,|\vec b|;\mu,\zeta),
\end{eqnarray}
where the parameter $M$ is the mass-scale (defined globally for all modules). The value of $n$ dependents on the type of the TMD distributions. Particularly, there are
\begin{itemize}
\item For \texttt{uTMDPDF}, \texttt{uTMDFF}
$$
n=0,\qquad F(x,|\vec k_T|;\mu,\zeta)=\int \frac{d|\vec b|}{2\pi}|\vec  b| J_0(|\vec b||\vec k_T|) F(x,|\vec b|;\mu,\zeta),
$$

\item For \texttt{SiversTMDPDF}, \texttt{BoerMuldersTMDPDF}, \texttt{wgtTMDPDF}
$$
n=1,\qquad F(x,|\vec k_T|;\mu,\zeta)=\frac{M^2}{k_T}\int \frac{d|\vec b|}{2\pi}|\vec  b|^2 J_1(|\vec b||\vec k_T|) F(x,|\vec b|;\mu,\zeta),
$$

\item For \texttt{lpTMDPDF}
$$
n=2,\qquad F(x,|\vec k_T|;\mu,\zeta)=\frac{M^4}{2k_T^2}\int \frac{d|\vec b|}{2\pi}|\vec  b|^3 J_2(|\vec b||\vec k_T|) F(x,|\vec b|;\mu,\zeta),
$$
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Clenshaw-Curtis-Levin algorithm}. The following algorithm provides sufficient precision in the large range of $k_T$. It is a mixture of Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature and Levin differential-equation approach. First split the integral into ranges
\begin{eqnarray}
\{B_0,...,B_N\},
\end{eqnarray}
where $b_0$ is sufficiently small (default $B_0=10^{-6}$) and $B_n$ is sufficiently large (default $B_n\sim 25-100$). Then the integral is split as
\begin{eqnarray}
F(q)=\int_0^\infty db J_0(bq)f(b)= \sum_{n=1}^{N}\int_{B_{n-1}}^{B_{n}}db J_0(bq)f(b)+\Delta_0+\Delta_N,
\end{eqnarray}
where
$$\Delta_0=\int_0^{B_0}db J_0(bq)f(b),\qquad \Delta_N=\int_{B_N}^\infty db J_0(bq)f(b).$$
Then for each sector one can estimate integral using different approaches. Here, I use the approaches that are quadratures over the nodes of Chebishev polynomials with
\begin{eqnarray}
t_i=\cos \frac{i\pi}{K},
\end{eqnarray}
where $N$ is the size of the grid. So, for each interval $[B_{n-1},B_{n}]$ one defines a grid with (K+1) points (ultimate points enters two sub-grids). The points are distributed logarithmically. So
\begin{eqnarray}
b_{nk}=\exp\(\delta_n t_k+\bar b_n\),\qquad \delta_n=\frac{B_{n}-B_{n-1}}{2},\qquad \bar b_n=\frac{B_{n}+B_{n-1}}{2},
\end{eqnarray}
where $n\in [1,N]$ and $k\in [0,K]$. The integral is then defined as
\begin{eqnarray}
\int_{B_{n-1}}^{B_n}db J_0(bq)f(b)=\sum_{k=0}^K w_{nk}(q)f(b_{nk}),
\end{eqnarray}
where $w_{nk}(q)$ is precomputed by different algorithm.

The \textit{Clenshaw-Curtis} quadrature leads to
\begin{eqnarray}
\int_{B_{n-1}}^{B_n}db J_0(bq)f(b)=\int_{-1}^1 dt \delta_n b(t) J_0(b(t))f(b(t))=\sum_{k=0}^K w^{\text{CC}}_{nk}(q)f(b_{nk}),
\end{eqnarray}
where
\begin{eqnarray}
w^{\text{CC}}_{nk}(q)=\delta_n b_{nk} J_0(b_{nk})a_k,\qquad a_k=\frac{4\beta_k}{K}\sum_{l=0,2,..}^{K}\frac{\beta_l}{1-l^2}\cos\frac{kl\pi}{K},
\end{eqnarray}
with $\beta_i=1/2$ for $i=1$ or $i=K$ and $\beta_i=1$ otherwise.

The \textit{Levin} approach consists in the consideration of the differential system \textit{(to be written later)}, which can be bootstraped on the grid, and leads to the system of linear equations. In case of present integral it requires the inversion of the Matrix
\begin{eqnarray}
A(q)=
\(\begin{array}{cc}
\frac{D}{b \delta} & qI\\
-q I & \frac{D}{b \delta}-\frac{I}{b}  
\end{array}\),
\end{eqnarray}
where $D$ is the derivative matrix for the Chebyshev interpolation, and $1/b$ is understood as division by $b_i$ for corresponding row. The inverse of this matrix is made by Crout's method (the routine is derived from \texttt{https://github.com/Beliavsky/Matrix\_Inversion}). Then the weights are
\begin{eqnarray}
w^{\text{L}}_{nk}(q)=J_0(B_{n}q)A^{-1}_{1k}-J_0(B_{n-1}q)A^{-1}_{K+1,k}+J_1(B_{n}q)A^{-1}_{K+2,k}-J_1(B_{n-1}q)A^{-1}_{2K+2,k}.
\end{eqnarray}
Note, that it can be written as vector sum
\begin{eqnarray}
\vec w^{\text{L}}_{n}(q)=J_0(B_{n}q)\vec A^{-1}_{1}-J_0(B_{n-1}q)\vec A^{-1}_{K+1}+J_1(B_{n}q)\vec A^{-1}_{K+2}-J_1(B_{n-1}q)\vec A^{-1}_{2K+2},
\end{eqnarray}
where $\vec A_k$ is [1,K] part of the $k$'th row.

This approaches are used in different ranges.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Oscillatory integral} If the Bessel function is already oscillating in the range. In this case the integral is computed by Levin method.
\item \textit{Stable integral} If the Bessel function is not yet oscillating in the range. In this case the Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature is used.
\end{itemize}
Basically, for small-(bq) one should use CC quadrature, and for other cases Levin quadrature. To distinguish these case I use the inequality
\begin{eqnarray}
w_{nk}(q)=
\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
w^{\text{CC}}_{nk}(q),& \text{if}~B_nq < j_0 \alpha,
\\
w^{\text{L}}_{nk}(q),&\text{otherwise,}
\end{array}\right.%}
\end{eqnarray}
where $j_0$ is the first zero of Bessel function, and $\alpha$ is a parameter of order 1 (default $\alpha=1$). 

Finally, the correction to the integral could be estimated. The tale correction is known [cite]
\begin{eqnarray}
\Delta_N\sim f(B_N),
\end{eqnarray}
so using sufficiently large $B_N$ we get very small correction. The first point correction can be estimated assuming smooth and non-singular behavior of $f(b)$
\begin{eqnarray}
\Delta_0=\int_0^{B_0} db J_0(b q)f(b)\simeq\int_0^{B_0} db J_0(b q) b \frac{f(B_0)}{B_0} = \frac{J_1(B_0 q)}{q}f(B_0)\simeq B_0\frac{f(B_0)}{2}.
\end{eqnarray}
Practically, I add ($n=1$, $k=K$ corresponds to $B_0$ node)
\begin{eqnarray}
w_{1K}\to  w_{1K}+\frac{J_1(B_0 q)}{q}.
\end{eqnarray}

\subsection{TMM}
\label{sec:TMM}

In ref.[2402.01836] \cite{delRio:2024vvq} the following TMMs are defined
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathcal{G}_{n,n}[F]=\mathcal{G}[F]&=&\frac{1}{n!}\int_0^\infty db \mu \(\frac{\mu b}{2}\)^n J_{n+1}(\mu b)F(x,b)
\\
\mathcal{G}_{n+1,n}[F]=\mathcal{X}[F]&=&\frac{1}{2M^2n!}\int_0^\infty db \mu^3 \(\frac{\mu b}{2}\)^n \frac{(n+1)J_{n+1}(\mu b)-J_{n+3}(\mu b)}{n+2}F(x,b)
\\\nn
&=&
\frac{1}{2M^2n!}\int_0^\infty db \mu^3 \(\frac{\mu b}{2}\)^n \(J_{n+1}(\mu b)-\frac{J_{n+2}(\mu b)}{(\mu b)}\)F(x,b)
\end{eqnarray}
The correspond to the cut-integral over TMD and particular TMMs. The value of n is defined by the type of TMD (see sec.\ref{sec:Fourier_to_kt}).

\section{\texttt{TMDs} module}
\label{TMDs}

The module \texttt{TMDs} joins the lower modules and performs the evaluation of various TMD distributions in the $\zeta$-prescription. Generally a TMD distribution is given by the expression
\begin{eqnarray}
F_f(x,b;\mu,\zeta)=R_f[b,(\mu,\zeta)\to(\mu_i,\zeta_{\mu_i})]\tilde F_f(x,b),
\end{eqnarray}
where $R$ is the TMD evolution kernel, $\tilde F$ is a TMD distribution at low scale. The scale $\mu_i$ is dependent on the evolution type, and could be out of use. Note, that \texttt{TMDs} initializes the lower modules automatically. Therefore, no special initializations should be done.

\subsection{Definition of low-scales}
\label{TMDs:mus}

The low scales $\mu_i$ and $\mu_0$ are defined in the functions \texttt{mu{\_}LOW(bt)} and \texttt{mu0(bt)} which can be found in the end of \texttt{TMDs.f90} code. Modify it if needed.



\subsection{Evaluating TMDs}
\label{TMDs:TMDs}

The expression for unpolarized TMD PDF is obtained by the functions

(real*8(-5:5))\texttt{uTMDPDF{\_}5(x,b,mu,zeta,h)}

where 
\begin{itemize}
\item [\texttt{x}] (real*8) Bjorken-$x$ ($0<x<1$)
\item [\texttt{b}] (real*8) Transverse distance ($b>0$) in GeV
\item [\texttt{mu}] (real*8) The scale $\mu_f$ in GeV. Typically, $\mu_f=Q$.
\item [\texttt{zeta}] (real*8) The scale $\zeta_f$ in GeV$^2$. Typically, $\zeta_f=Q^2$.
\item [\texttt{h}] (integer) The hadron type. If $h<0$, the hadron is anti-hadron.
\end{itemize}
This function return the vector real*8(-5:5) for $\bar b, \bar c, \bar s,\bar u,\bar d ,?,d,u,s, c, b$.

\begin{itemize}
\item Gluon contribution in \texttt{uTMDPDF{\_}5} is undefined, but taken into account in the mixing contribution. The point is that evaluation of gluons slow down the procedure approximately by $40\%$, and often is not needed. To calculate the full flavor vector with the gluon TMD, call \texttt{uTMDPDF{\_}50(x,b,mu,zeta,h)}, where all arguments defined in the same way.

\item The other TMDs, such as unpolarized TMDFF, transversity, etc. are obtained by similar function see the table in the beginning of the section.

\item Each function has version without parameters \texttt{mu} and \texttt{zeta}. It corresponds to the evaluation of a TMS at optimal line \cite{Scimemi:2018xaf}. Practically, it just transfers the outcome of corresponding TMD module, e.g.module \texttt{uTMDPDF}, see sec.\ref{uTMDPDF}.

\item For $h<0$ the quark-distributions are replaced by anti-quark distributions and vice versa. I.e. $F(-h)=F(h)(5:-5:-1)$ [it is done in TMDs-Modules]
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Products of TMDs}
\label{TMDs:products}

The the evaluation of majority of cross-sections one needs the product of two TMDs at the same scale. There are set of functions which return these products. They are slightly faster then just evaluation and multiplication, due to the flavor blindness of the TMD evolution. The function have common interface

(real*8(-5:5)) \texttt{uPDF{\_}uPDF(x1,x2,b,mu,zeta,h1,h2)}

where
\begin{itemize}
\item [\texttt{x1,x2}] (real*8) Bjorken-$x$'s ($0<x<1$)
\item [\texttt{b}] (real*8) Transverse distance ($b>0$) in GeV
\item [\texttt{mu}] (real*8) The scale $\mu_f$ in GeV. Typically, $\mu_f=Q$.
\item [\texttt{zeta}] (real*8) The scale $\zeta_f$ in GeV$^2$. Typically, $\zeta_f=Q^2$.
\item [\texttt{h1,h2}] (integer) The hadron's types.
\end{itemize}
The function return a product of the form $F_{f_1\ot h_1}(x_1,b;\mu,\zeta)F_{f_2\ot h_2}(x_2,b;\mu,\zeta)$, where $f_{1,2}$ and the type of TMDs depend on the function.



\subsection{Theoretical uncertainties}
\label{TMDs:c123}

\texttt{TMDs\_SetScaleVariations(c1,c3,c4)} changes the scale multiplicative factors $c_i$ (see \cite{Scimemi:2018xaf}, sec.6). The default set of arguments is (1,1,1), i.e. the scales as they given in corresponding functions. This subroutine changes $c1$ and $c3$ constants and call corresponding subroutines for variation of $c4$ in TMD defining packages. Note, that in some types of evolution particular variations absent.

\section{\texttt{TMDF} module}
\label{TMDF}


This module evaluates the structure functions, that are universally defined as
\begin{eqnarray}\label{TMDF:F}
F(Q^2,q_T,x_1,x_2,\mu,\zeta_1,\zeta_2)=\int_0^\infty \frac{bdb}{2}b^n J_n(bq_T)\sum_{ff'} z_{ff'}(Q^2) F_1^f(x_1,b;\mu,\zeta_1)F_2^{f'}(x_2,b;\mu,\zeta_2),
\end{eqnarray}
where
\begin{itemize}
\item $Q^2$ is hard scale.
\item $q_T$ is transverse momentum in the factorization frame. It coincides with measured $q_T$ in center-mass frame for DY, but $q_T\sim p_T/z$ for SIDIS.
\item $x_1$ and $x_2$ are parts of collinear parton momenta. I.e. for DY $x_{1,2}\simeq Qe^{\pm y}/\sqrt{s}$, while for SIDIS $x_2\sim z$. It can also obtain power correction, ala Nachmann variables.
\item $\mu$ is the hard factorization scale $\mu \sim Q$
\item $\zeta_{1,2}$ are rapidity factorization scales. In the standard factorization scheme $\zeta_1\zeta_2=Q^4$. It can also be modified by power corrections.
\item $f,f'$ are parton flavors.
\item $z_{ff'}$ is the process related function. E.g. for photon DY on $p+\bar p$, $z_{ff'}=\delta_{ff'}|e_f|^2.$
\item $n$ The order of Bessel transformation is defined by structure function. E.g. for unpolarized DY $n=1$. For SSA's $n=1$. In general for angular modulation $\sim \cos (n\theta)$.
\item $F_{1,2}^f$ TMD distribution (PDF or FF) of necessary polarization and flavor.
\end{itemize}
Some structure functions are multiplied by a constant with mass dimension (e.g. Sivers asymmetry). This constant (called global mass scale = $M$) is defined globally in the constants file.

\subsection{Initialization}
\label{TMDF:init}

Prior the usage module is to be initialized (once per run) by

\texttt{call TMDF{\_}Initialize(file)}

It reads \texttt{constants-file} and initialize it-self accordingly.

\subsection{Evaluating Structure functions}
\label{TMDF:TMDF}

The value of the structure function is obtained by

(real*8)\texttt{TMDF{\_}F(Q2,qT,x1,x2,mu,zeta1,zeta2,N)}

where 
\begin{itemize}
\item [\texttt{Q2}] (real*8) hard scale in GeV$^2$.
\item [\texttt{qT}] (real*8) modulus of transverse momentum in the factorization frame in GeV, $q_T>0$
\item [\texttt{x1}] (real*8) $x$ passed to the first TMD distribution  ($0<x1<1$)
\item [\texttt{x2}] (real*8) $x$ passed to the first TMD distribution ($0<x2<1$)
\item [\texttt{mu}] (real*8) The hard scale $\mu$ in GeV. Typically, $\mu=Q$.
\item [\texttt{zeta1}] (real*8) The scale $\zeta_f$ in GeV$^2$ for the first TMD distribution. Typically, $\zeta_f=Q^2$.
\item [\texttt{zeta2}] (real*8) The scale $\zeta_f$ in GeV$^2$ for the second TMD distribution. Typically, $\zeta_f=Q^2$.
\item [\texttt{N}] (integer) The number of process.
\end{itemize}
The function returns the value of 
\begin{eqnarray}
F^N(Q^2,q_T,x_1,x_2,\mu,\zeta_1,\zeta_2)=\int_0^\infty \frac{bdb}{2}b^n J_n(bq_T)\sum_{ff'} z^N_{ff'}(Q^2) F_1^f(x_1,b;\mu,\zeta_1)F_2^{f'}(x_2,b;\mu,\zeta_2).
\end{eqnarray}
The parameter $n$ depends on the argument \texttt{N} and uniformly defined as 
\begin{eqnarray*}
n=0 &\qquad\qquad& \text{for \texttt{N}}<10000
\\
n=1 &\qquad\qquad& \text{for \texttt{N}}\in[10000,20000]
\\
n=2 &\qquad\qquad& \text{for \texttt{N}}\in[20000,30000]
\\
n=3 &\qquad\qquad& \text{for \texttt{N}}>30000
\end{eqnarray*}
The particular values of $z_{ff'}$ and $F_{1,2}$ are given in the following table. User function can be implemented by code modification.

\textbf{Notes on the integral evaluation:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The integral is uniformly set to 0 for $q_T<10^{-7}$.
\item The integrand is uniformly set to 0 for $b>10^{3}$.
\item If for any element of evaluation (including TMD evolution factors and convolution integrals, and the integral of the structure function it-self) obtained divergent value. The trigger is set to ON. In this case, the integral returns uniformly large value $10^{100}$ for all integrals without evaluation. The trigger is reset by new values of NP parameters. It is done in order to cut the improper values of NP parameters in the fastest possible way, which speed up fitting procedures.
\item The Fourier is made by Ogata quadrature, which is double exponential quadrature. I.e.
\begin{eqnarray}
\int_0^\infty \frac{bdb}{2} b^n I(b) J_n(q_Tb)\simeq \frac{1}{q_T^{n+2}}\sum_{k=1}^\infty \tilde \omega_{nk} b_{nk}^{n+1} I\(\frac{b_{nk}}{q_T}\),
\end{eqnarray}
where
$$
b_{nk}=\frac{\psi(\tilde h \tilde \xi_{nk})}{\tilde h}=\tilde \xi_{nk} \tanh(\frac{\pi}{2}\sinh(\tilde h \tilde \xi_{nk}))
$$
$$
\tilde \omega_{nk}=\frac{J_n(\tilde b_{nk})}{\tilde\xi_{nk} J^2_{n+1}(\tilde \xi_{nk})}\psi'(\tilde h \tilde \xi_{nk})
$$
Here, $\tilde \xi_{nk}$ is $k$'th zero of $J_n(x)$ function. Note, that $\tilde h=h/\pi$ in the original Ogata's notation.
\item The convergence properties of the quadrature essentially depends on $h$. I have found that $h\sim q_T$. For accurate evolution of integrals at different values of $q_T$ I set $h=h_0 s$, where $s$ is defined for intervals of $q_T$.
\item The sum over $k$ is restricted by $N_{\text{max}}$ where $N_{\text{max}}$ is hard coded number, $N_{\text{max}}=200$. 
\item The sum over $k$ is evaluated until the sum of absolute values of last four terms is less then \textit{tolerance}. If $M>N_{\text{max}}$ the integral declared divergent, and the trigger is set to ON.
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}
\begin{center}
\textbf{WARNING!}
\\
The error for Ogata quadrature is defined by parameters $h$ and $M$(number of terms in the sum over $k$). In the parameter $M$ quadrature is double-exponential, i.e. converges fast as $M$ approaches $N_{\text{max}}$. And the convergence of the sum can be simply checked. In the parameter $h$ the quadrature is quadratic (the convergence is rather poor). The convergence to the true value of integral is very expensive especially at large $q_T$ (it requires the complete reevaluation of integral at all nodes). Unfortunately, $N_{\text{max}}\sim h^{-1}$, and has to find the balance value for $h$. In principle, TMD functions decays rather fast, and suggested default value $h=0.005$ is trustful. \textbf{Nonetheless, we suggest to test other values (*/2) of $h$ to validate the obtained values in your model.}

The adaptive check of convergence will implemented in the future versions.

\subsection{Tests}
\label{TMDF:tests}

The test options are called by process number $N+0$, $N+9999$ and $N+9998$. In these case, the integrand set by a fixed function. In the case $N+0$
\begin{eqnarray}
N+0:\qquad \sum z FF \to e^{-0.2b}.
\end{eqnarray}
The cases $N+9999$ and $N+9998$ are dependent on parameters of the function:
\begin{eqnarray}
N+9999:\qquad \sum z FF \to e^{-\mu b}(1+x_1 b^2+x_2 b^4),
\\
N+9998:\qquad \sum z FF \to e^{-\mu b^2}(1+x_1 b^2+x_2 b^4).
\end{eqnarray}
In all cases the Hankel integral could be evaluated. They read
\begin{eqnarray}
\text{9999}:&\qquad& F=\frac{1}{2\mu^2(1+X)^{3/2}}\(1+\frac{x_1}{\mu^2}\frac{6-9X}{(1+X)^2}+\frac{15x_2}{\mu^4}\frac{8-40X+15 X^2}{(1+X)^4}\),
\\
\text{19999}:&\qquad& F=\frac{3\sqrt{X}}{2\mu^3(1+X)^{5/2}}\(1+\frac{5x_1}{\mu^2}\frac{4-3X}{(1+X)^2}+\frac{105x_2}{\mu^4}\frac{8-20X+5 X^2}{(1+X)^4}\),
\\
\text{29999}:&\qquad& F=\frac{15 X}{2\mu^4(1+X)^{7/2}}\(1+\frac{21x_1}{\mu^2}\frac{2-X}{(1+X)^2}+\frac{63x_2}{\mu^4}\frac{48-80X+15 X^2}{(1+X)^4}\),
\\
\text{39999}:&\qquad& F=\frac{105 X^{3/2}}{2\mu^5(1+X)^{9/2}}\(1+\frac{9x_1}{\mu^2}\frac{8-3X}{(1+X)^2}+\frac{495x_2}{\mu^4}\frac{16-20X+3 X^2}{(1+X)^4}\),
\end{eqnarray}
where $X=q_T^2/\mu^2$.
\begin{eqnarray}
\text{9998}:&\qquad& F=\frac{e^{-Y}}{4\mu}\(1+\frac{x_1}{\mu}(1-Y)+\frac{x_2}{\mu^2}(2-4Y+Y^2)\),
\\
\text{19998}:&\qquad& F=\frac{e^{-Y}\sqrt{Y}}{4\mu^{3/2}}\(1+\frac{x_1}{\mu}(2-Y)+\frac{x_2}{\mu^2}(6-6Y+Y^2)\),
\\
\text{29998}:&\qquad& F=\frac{e^{-Y}Y}{4\mu^2}\(1+\frac{x_1}{\mu}(3-Y)+\frac{x_2}{\mu^2}(12-8Y+Y^2)\),
\\
\text{39998}:&\qquad& F=\frac{e^{-Y}Y^{3/2}}{4\mu^{5/2}}\(1+\frac{x_1}{\mu}(4-Y)+\frac{x_2}{\mu^2}(20-10Y+Y^2)\),
\end{eqnarray}
where $Y=q_T^2/(4\mu)$.

\section{\texttt{TMDX{\_}DY} module}
\label{TMDX}

This module evaluates cross-sections with the Drell-Yan-like kinematics. I.e. it expects the following kinematic input, $(s,Q,y)$ which defines the variables $x$'s, etc.

The general structure of the cross-section is
\begin{eqnarray}
\Delta\sigma(q_T)=\int_{bin} dX ~prefactor2~\times \sum_n F_n,
\end{eqnarray}
where $$dX=dQ^2 dy d q^2_T.$$ So, for a small bin
\begin{eqnarray}
\Delta\sigma(q_T)\approx\Delta X \frac{d\sigma}{dX},\qquad \Delta X=(Q_{\text{max}}^2-Q_{\text{min}}^2)(y_{\text{max}}-y_{\text{min}})(q_{T\text{max}}^2-q_{T\text{min}}^2).
\end{eqnarray}
\textit{Prefactor2} accumulates the definition of the phase-space, and general process. It has the form
\begin{eqnarray}
prefactor2=(\text{phase-space Jacobian})\times H(Q,\mu_H)
\end{eqnarray}
The $F_n$ is a contribution specific for a channel. Some processes have several channels, which could be computed together or separately (e.g. $\sim f_1f_1$ and $\sim h_1^\perp h_1^\perp$). Generally it has a form
\begin{eqnarray}
F_n=(\text{cuts for lepton pair})_n\times F_n(Q,q_T,x_1,x_2,\mu,\zeta_1,\zeta_2),
\end{eqnarray}
where $F$ is a product of TMDs and corresponding weight defined in (\ref{TMDF:F}) or (\ref{KPC:main}). There are following feature of current implementation
\begin{itemize}
\item In the current version the scaling variables are set as
\begin{eqnarray}
\mu^2=\zeta_1=\zeta_2=Q^2.
\end{eqnarray}
Currently, it is hard coded and could not be easily modified. However, there is a possibility to vary the value of $\mu$ as $\mu=c_2 Q$, where $c_2$ is variation parameter (see sec.\ref{TMDX:c2}).
\item For the definition of \textit{(cuts for lepton pair)}-function see \cite{Scimemi:2017etj}. It is evaluated within module \texttt{LeptonCutsDY.f90}. The presence of cuts, and their parameters are set by the \texttt{SetCuts} subroutine.
\item The expression for the hard factor $H$ is taken from \cite{Gehrmann:2010ue}. It is the function of $\ln(Q/\mu_H)$ and $a_s(\mu_H))$. Since in the current realization $\mu_H=Q$, the logarithm is replaced by $\ln(c_2)$, where $c_2$ is the variation constant.
\end{itemize}
\begin{tcolorbox}
The cross-section can be computed by two different means. Using LP factorization or using KPC-resummed factorization. The selection is done by the parameter A.p2. One behavior totally exclude another.

\subsection{Initialization}
\label{TMDX:init}

Prior the usage module is to be initialized (once per run) by

\texttt{call TMDX\_DY{\_}Initialize(file)}

The order of used coefficient function is set in \texttt{constant-file} by \texttt{'LO'}($a_s^0$), \texttt{'NLO'}($a_s^1$),\texttt{'NNLO'} or \texttt{'N2LO'}($a_s^2$), \texttt{'N3LO'}($a_s^3$), \texttt{'N4LO'}($a_s^4$). The value in brackets shows the maximum included perturbative order in the hard coefficient function.

\subsection{The parameters of cross-section}
\label{TMDX:setup}


\textbf{Process:} The process is encoded by integer numbers \texttt{(/p1,p2,p3,p4,p5,.../)} where
\begin{itemize}
\item[\texttt{p1}] (integer) Defines the $prefactor2$ that contains the phase space elements and the universal part of factorization formula. 
\item[\texttt{p2}] (integer) Defines the type of hadron 1.
\item[\texttt{p3}] (integer) Defines the type of hadron 2.
\item[\texttt{p4}] (integer) Defines the structure function $F$. See sec.\ref{TMDF:enum}. 
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Note:} \red{In artemide v.2.07 and earlier} the process was encoded by 3 numbers, and did not contained the types of hadrons.

\textbf{Kinematics:} Each bin is defined by $s$ (Mandelstam variable, GeV$^2$), $Q$ (virtuality, GeV, [min,max]), $y$ (rapidity, [min,max]) and $q_T$ (transverse momentum, GeV, [min,max]). If the order of limits is inverted the result is 0.

\textbf{Lepton cuts:} The fiducial cuts on the lepton pair are defined by two variables: logical \texttt{iC} (If \texttt{inc=.true.} the evaluation of cuts will be done, otherwise it will be ignored.). And the array of four reals \texttt{(p1,p2,eta1,eta2)}, such that the cuts are defined as
\begin{eqnarray}
|l_T|<\text{\texttt{p1}},\qquad |l'_T|<\text{\texttt{p2}},\qquad \text{\texttt{eta1}}<\eta,\eta',\text{\texttt{eta2}},
\end{eqnarray}
where $l$ and $l'$ are the momenta of produced leptons, with $l_T$'s being their transverse components and $\eta$'s being their rapidities. For accurate definition of the cut-function see sec.2.6 of \cite{Scimemi:2017etj} (particularly equations (2.40)-(2.42)).

\subsection{Cross-section evaluation}
\label{TMDX:xsec}

\begin{tcolorbox}
The main subroutine is called \texttt{xSec\_DY} and it have the following interface:

\begin{center}
\texttt{xSec\_DY(X,process,s,qT,Q,y,includeCuts,CutParameters,Num)}
\end{center}

where
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{X} is (real*8) value of cross-section.
\item \texttt{process} (integer)array \texttt{(p1,p2,p3,p4)}.
\item \texttt{s} is Mandelshtam variable $s$
\item \texttt{qT} is (real*8)array \texttt{(qtmin,qtmax)}
\item \texttt{Q} is (real*8)array \texttt{(Qmin,Qmax)}
\item \texttt{y} is (real*8)array \texttt{(ymin,ymax)}
\item \texttt{includeCuts} is logical
\item \texttt{CutParameters} is (real*8) array \texttt{(k1,k2,eta1,eta2)} \textbf{OPTIONAL}
\item \texttt{Num} is even integer that determine number of section in $q_T$ integral \textbf{OPTIONAL}
\end{itemize}
Note, that optional variables could be omit during the call. 
\end{tcolorbox}
\textbf{IMPORTANT: } Practically, the call of this function coincides with $\texttt{X}$ evaluated by the following set of commands
\\
\texttt{call TMDX\_DY{\_}SetProcess(process)}
\\
\texttt{call TMDX\_DY{\_}XSetup(s,\red{any},\red{any})}
\\
\texttt{call SetCuts(includeCuts,k1,k2,eta1,eta2)}
\\
\texttt{call CalcXsec\_DY{\_}PTint{\_}Qint{\_}Yint} \texttt{(X,qtmin,qtmax,Qmin,Qmax,yMin,yMax,Num)}

\begin{tcolorbox}
\textbf{\blue{There is also an analogous subroutine that evaluate cross-section by list.}} It is called \texttt{xSec\_DY\_List} and it have the following interface:
\begin{center}
\texttt{xSec\_DY\_List(X,process,s,qT,Q,y,includeCuts,CutParameters,Num)}
\end{center}
All variables are analogues to those of \texttt{xSec\_DY}, but should come in lists, i.e. \texttt{X} is (1:n), \texttt{process} is (1:n,1:4), \texttt{s} is (1:n), \texttt{qT},\texttt{Q},\texttt{y} are (1:n,1:2), \texttt{includeCuts} is (1:n), \texttt{CutParameters} is (1:n,1:4), and \texttt{Num} is (1:n). \textbf{Only the \texttt{Num} argument is OPTIONAL arguments. The argument \texttt{CutParameters} must be presented}. This command compiled by OPENMP, so runs in parallel on multi-core computers.

In addition there is a subroutine \texttt{xSec\_DY\_List\_APPROXIMATE} with the same interface:
\begin{center}
\texttt{xSec\_DY\_List\_APPROXIMATE(X,process,s,qT,Q,y,includeCuts,CutParameters,Num)}
\end{center}
It does the same job as \texttt{xSec\_DY\_List}, however using simplified bin-integration routines (non-adaptive). It is several times faster, but has limited numerical precision.
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}
\textbf{Finally, \blue{there is an also analogous subroutine that evaluate cross-section by list without bin-integration.}} It is called \texttt{xSec\_DY\_List\_BINLESS} and it have the following interface:

\begin{center}
\texttt{xSec\_DY\_List\_BINLESS(X,process,s,qT,Q,y,includeCuts,CutParameters,Num)}
\end{center}
All variables are analogues to those of \texttt{xSec\_DY\_List}, but should come in lists of central values, i.e. \texttt{X} is (1:n), \texttt{process} is (1:n,1:4), \texttt{s} is (1:n), \texttt{qT},\texttt{Q},\texttt{y} \blue{are (1:n)}, \texttt{includeCuts} is (1:n), \texttt{CutParameters} is (1:n,1:4), and \texttt{Num} is (1:n). \textbf{Only the \texttt{Num} argument is OPTIONAL arguments. The argument \texttt{CutParameters} must be presented}. This command compiled by OPENMP, so runs in parallel on multi-core computers.
\end{tcolorbox}

\textbf{Extra notes:}
\begin{itemize}
\item The integrations over $Q$ and $y$ are adaptive Simpsons. We have found that it is the fastest (adaptive) method for typical cross-sections with tolerance $10^{-3}-10^{-4}$. Naturally, it is not suitable for higher precision, which however is not typically required.
\item The integration over $p_T$ is not adaptive, since typically $p_T$-bins are rather smooth and integral is already accurate if approximated by 4-8 points (default minimal value is set in INI-file, and is automatically increased for larger bins). For unexceptionally large $q_T$-bins, or very rapid behavior we suggest to use overloaded versions with manual set of $N$ (number of integral sections).
\item For very small value of $q_T$ the cross-section is frozen at $q_{T(abs~min)}$, which is defined in INI-file ($10^{-4}$ by default). It is done to avoid badly converging integrals.
\item The evaluation can be done in parallel. The list commands are parallel by default. Basically, in this case, individual values for the list of cross-sections are evaluated in parallel. Unfortunately the parallel scaling-rate is not very high, on 8 processors it is about 400\%-500\% only. The parallelization is made with OPENMP library. To make the parallel computation possible, add \texttt{-fopenmp} option in the compilation instructions. The maximum number of allowed threads is set \texttt{constants-file}.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{\texttt{LeptonCutsDY}}

The calculation of cut prefactor is made in \texttt{LeptonCutsDY.f90}. It has two public procedures: \texttt{SetCutParameters}, and \texttt{CutFactor}. 
\begin{itemize}
\item The subroutine \texttt{SetCutParameters(kT,eta1,eta2)} set a default version of cut parameters: $p_{1,2}<k_T$ and $\eta_1<\eta<\eta_2$.
\item The overloaded version of the subroutine \texttt{SetCutParameters(k1,k2,eta1,eta2)} set a default version of asymmetric cut parameters. $p_{1}<k_1$,$p_2<k_2$ and $\eta_1<\eta<\eta_2$.
\item Function \texttt{CutFactor(qT,Q\_in,y\_in, CutParameters)} calculates the cut prefactor at the point $q_T$, $Q$, $y$. The argument \texttt{CutParameters} is \textbf{optional}. If it is not present, cut parameters are taken from default values (which are set by \texttt{SetCutParameters}). \texttt{CutParameters} is array \texttt{(/ k1,k2,eta1,eta2/)}. The usage of global definition for \texttt{CutParameters} is not recommended, since it can result into running condition during parallel computation. This is interface is left fro compatibility with earlier version of \texttt{artemide}.
\end{itemize}

\label{TMDX:c2}

TO BE WRITTEN

\subsection{Options for evaluation of DY-like cross-section}

\subsubsection{$\pi^2$-resummation}

The coefficient function of DY-like cross-section $|C_V|^2$ is evaluated at $(-q^2)$ (space-like momentum). Thus, it has contributions $\sim \pi^2$, which could be large, especially in the case of Higgs-boson production, see discussion in  refs.{Ahrens:2009cxz, Ahrens:2008qu}. These corrections could be resummed by RG technique \cite{Ahrens:2008qu}. So,
\begin{eqnarray}
|C_V(-q^2)|^2\to U_\pi |C_V(q^2)|^2,
\end{eqnarray}
where $U_\pi$ is the resummation exponent for $\pi a_s$-correction. At LO it reads \cite{Ahrens:2008qu}
\begin{eqnarray}
U_\pi=\exp\(\frac{\Gamma_0}{2a_s\beta_0^2}[2 a \arctan a-\ln(1+a^2)]\),\qquad a=\pi a_s.
\end{eqnarray}
To use the $\pi$-resummed coefficient function switch the corresponded option in \texttt{constants-file} (Option 9.A.p3).

\subsubsection{Power corrections}

There are many sources of power corrections. For a moment there is no systematic studies of power corrections for TMD factorization. Nonetheless I include some options in \texttt{artemide}, and plan to make more systematic treatment in the future.

\textbf{Exact values of $x_{1,2}$ for DY:} The TMD distributions enter the cross-section with $x_1$ and $x_2$ equal to
\begin{eqnarray}
x_1&=&\frac{q^+}{p_1^+}=\frac{Q}{\sqrt{s}}e^y\sqrt{1+\frac{\vec q_T^2}{Q^2}}\simeq \frac{Q}{\sqrt{s}}e^y,
\\\nn
x_1&=&\frac{q^+}{p_1^+}=\frac{Q}{\sqrt{s}}e^{-y}\sqrt{1+\frac{\vec q_T^2}{Q^2}} \simeq \frac{Q}{\sqrt{s}}e^{-y}.
\end{eqnarray}
Traditionally, the corrections $\sim q_T/Q$ are dropped, since they are power corrections. Nonetheless, they could be included since they have different sources in comparison to power corrections to the factorized cross-section. Usage of one or another version of $x_{1,2}$ is switched in \texttt{constants-file} (Option 9.A.p2).

\textbf{Exact values for hard scale for DY:} The TMD hard coefficient function contains $\ln(|2q^+q^-|/\mu^2)$ which is usually approximated by $\ln(Q^2)$. Similarly, the $zeta$-scales are normalized as $\zeta \bar \zeta=(2q^+q^-)^2$, which is usually approximated by $Q^4$. So, the exact values of scales are
\begin{eqnarray}
\mu=\sqrt{Q^2+\vec q_T^2},\qquad \zeta_1=\zeta_2=Q^2+\vec q_T^2.
\end{eqnarray}
Traditionally, the corrections $\sim q_T/Q$ are dropped, since they are power corrections. Nonetheless, they could be included since they have different sources in comparison to power corrections to the factorized cross-section. Usage of one or another version of $scales$ is switched in \texttt{constants-file} (Option 9.A.p4).

\section{\texttt{TMDX{\_}SIDIS} module}
\label{TMDXs}

This module evaluates cross-sections with the SIDIS-like kinematics. I.e. it expects the following kinematic input, $(Q,x,z)$ or $(Q,y,z)$ or $(x,y,z)$, that are equivalent.

The general structure of the cross-section is
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{d\sigma}{dX}=
d\sigma(q_T)=\int [bin] ~prefactor2~\times F,
\end{eqnarray}
where 
\begin{eqnarray}
dX=dx dQ^2d\vec p_T^2.
\end{eqnarray}
For further specifications of parameters see sec.\ref{sec:SIDIS:theory}.

\blue{*)}The structure of the module repeats the structure of \texttt{TMDX{\_}DY} module, with the main change in the kinematic definition. Most part of routines has the same input and output with only replacement \texttt{{\_}DY}$\to$\texttt{{\_}SIDIS}. We do not comment such commands. They marked by $*$ in the following table.
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{Cross-section evaluation}
\label{TMDXs:xsec}

\begin{tcolorbox}
The computation of SIDIS cross-section is called by the following subroutine:

\begin{center}
\texttt{xSec\_SIDIS(X,process,s,pT,z,x,Q,incC,cuts,masses)}
\end{center}

where
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{X} is (real*8) value of cross-section.
\item \texttt{process} is (integer)array \texttt{(p1,p2,p3,p4)} (described below).
\item \texttt{s} is (real*8) Mandelshtam variable $s$
\item \texttt{pT} is (real*8) array \texttt{(qtmin,qtmax)}
\item \texttt{z} is (real*8) array \texttt{(zmin,zmax)}
\item \texttt{x} is (real*8) array \texttt{(xmin,xmax)}
\item \texttt{Q} is (real*8) array \texttt{(Qmin,Qmax)}
\item \texttt{incC} is (logical) flag to include cuts.
\item \texttt{cuts} is (real*8) array \texttt{(ymin,ymax,W2min,W2max)} that parameterizes kinematic cuts.
\item \texttt{masses} is (real*8) array \texttt{(mt,mp)} which is ($M_{target},m_{produced}$) in GeV \blue{OPTIONAL}. If not specified, considered as zeros.
\end{itemize}
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}
\textbf{\blue{There is also analogous subroutine that evaluate cross-section by list.}} It is called \texttt{xSec\_SIDIS\_List} and it have the following interface:

\begin{center}
\texttt{xSec\_SIDIS\_List(X,process,s,pT,z,x,Q,incC,cuts,masses)}
\end{center}
All variables are analogues to those of \texttt{xSec\_SIDIS}, but should come in lists, i.e. \texttt{X} is (1:n), \texttt{process} is (1:n,1:4), \texttt{s} is (1:n), \texttt{pT},\texttt{x},\texttt{Q},\texttt{z} are (1:n,1:2). This command compiled by OPENMP, so runs in parallel on multi-core computers.
\end{tcolorbox}

In addition to these main subroutines the following sub-routines are defined
\begin{center}
\texttt{xSec\_SIDIS\_BINLESS(proc,s,pt,z,x,Q,m1,m2)}
\end{center}
Compute cross-section without integration over bin (and also ignoring any possible bin-cut options). All kinematic variables are (real*8).

There harpy-interface prevents using optional variables. Thus there are separate copies of the function with argument \texttt{masses} being obligatory:
\begin{center}
\texttt{xSec\_SIDIS\_List\_forharpy(xx,process,s,pT,z,x,Q,doCut,Cuts,masses)}
\\
\texttt{xSec\_SIDIS\_BINLESS\_List\_forharpy(xx,process,s,pT,z,x,Q,masses)}
\end{center}

\subsection{Enumeration of processes}

The enumeration of processes for SIDIS is analogous to the DY case. Namely, each process is defined by 4 integer numbers
$$\texttt{[p1, p2, p3, p4]}$$
with
\begin{itemize}
\item $p_1$ indicates type of $prefactor2$ to use. Depending on this prefactor also the integral over phase space may differ. See the table below for details.
\item $p_2$ is the number of the target hadron (i.e. the hadron associated with TMDPDF)
\item $p_3$ is the number of the produced hadron (i.e. the hadron associated with TMDFF)
\item $p_4$ indicates the process (structure function). See the table below for details.
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}
List of enumeration for $prefactor2$
\\
\texttt{p1}
\\
\begin{tabular}{||l|c||p{12cm}||}
\hline\hline
\texttt{p1} & ~~$prefactor2$~~&  Short description 
\\\hline
0 & $1$ & For tests and cross-checks.
\\\hline
1 & $R_C$ & The cross-section $\frac{d\sigma}{dx dQ^2 dz d(p_\perp^2)}$. The factor $R_C$ is defined below.
\\\hline
2 & $\frac{Q^2}{y} R_C$& The cross-section $\frac{d\sigma}{dx dy dz d(p_\perp^2)}$, in this case integration over $Q^2$ is replaced by integration over $y$.
\\\hline
3 & $\frac{x}{y} R_C$ & The cross-section $\frac{d\sigma}{dy dQ^2 dz d(p_\perp^2)}$, in this case integration over $x$ is replaced by integration over $y$.
\\\hline\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
The factor $R_C$ is standard normalization of the cross-section (however without factor $1+\gamma^2/2x$, which is obsolete)
\begin{eqnarray}
R_C=\frac{2\pi \alpha_{\text{em}}^2(Q)}{Q^4\sqrt{1-\gamma^2 \vec \rho_\perp^2}}\frac{y^2}{1-\varepsilon}|C_V^{SIDIS}(c_2Q)|^2 c^{(un)}_0 R_t~~\text{[pb/GeV$^2$]},
\end{eqnarray}
with $R_t=0.3893379\times 10^9$ the transformation factor from GeV to pb, and 
$$
c_0^{(un)}=1+\frac{\vec p_\perp^2}{(zQ)^2}\frac{\varepsilon-\frac{\gamma^2}{2}}{1-\gamma^2\rho^2}
=1+\frac{\vec q_T^2}{Q^2}\frac{\varepsilon-\frac{\gamma^2}{2}}{1+\gamma^2}
.
$$
Note, that different parts of this formula can be switched on/off by parameters of the power-corrections.

\subsection{Kinematic cuts}
\label{TMDXs:cuts}

Some experiments put extra constraints on the measurement. Typically, such constraint has the form
\begin{eqnarray}
y_{\min}<y<y_{\max},\qquad W^2_{\min}<W^2<W_{\max}^2.
\end{eqnarray}
In this case the integration over $x$ and $Q^2$ has additional restrictions. Say, if one integrates over a bin: $x_{\min}<x<x_{\max}$ and $Q_{\min}<Q<Q_{\max}$ the boundaries of the bin should be modified as (here integration over $x$ is before the integration over $Q$)
\begin{eqnarray}
\hat x_{\text{min}}(Q)<x<\hat x_{\text{max}}(Q),
\qquad
\hat Q^2_{\text{min}}<Q^2<\hat Q^2_{\text{max}}.
\end{eqnarray}
where
\begin{eqnarray*}
\hat x_{\text{min}}(Q)&=&\max\{x_{\text{min}},\frac{Q^2}{y_{\text{max}}(s-M^2)},\frac{Q^2}{Q^2+W^2_{\text{max}}-M^2}\},
\\
\hat x_{\text{max}}(Q)&=&\min\{x_{\text{max}},\frac{Q^2}{y_{\text{min}}(s-M^2)},\frac{Q^2}{Q^2+W^2_{\text{min}}-M^2}\},
\\
\hat Q^2_{\text{min}}&=&\max\{Q^2_{\text{min}},x_{\text{min}}y_{\text{min}}(s-M^2),\frac{x_{\text{min}}}{1-x_{\text{min}}}(W^2_{\text{min}}-M^2)\},
\\
\hat Q^2_{\text{max}}&=&\min\{Q^2_{\text{max}},x_{\text{max}}y_{\text{max}}(s-M^2),\frac{x_{\text{max}}}{1-x_{\text{max}}}(W^2_{\text{max}}-M^2)\}.
\end{eqnarray*}
If some cut is not required, then set corresponding parameter to limiting value, such as $y_{\min}=0$, $y_{\max}=1$, $W^2_{\min}=0$, $W^2_{\max}\gg Q^2$.

\textbf{Important:} If due to cuts the minimal and maximum values of parameter are inverted, the resulting cross-section is immediately set to zero.

\subsection{Power corrections}

There are many sources of power corrections. For a moment there is no systematic studies of of effect of power corrections for TMD factorization. Nonetheless we include some options in \texttt{artemide}, and plan to make systematic treatment in the future.

\textbf{Kinematic corrections to the variables/phase space.} There are three sources of kinematic corrections to the variables
\begin{eqnarray}\nn
\frac{p_\perp}{Q},\qquad \frac{M}{Q},\qquad \frac{m}{Q},
\end{eqnarray}
where $M$ is the target mass, $m$ is the mass of the fragmented hadron. These terms appear in many places of the SIDIS expression (see sec.\ref{sec:SIDIS:theory}, for some minimal details), even without accounting for power-suppressed terms in the factorization formula. The nice feature of these correction is that they could be accounted exactly. The majority of these terms appears during of the Lorentz transformation of factorization frame (where the factorization is performed) to the laboratory frame (where the measurement is made).

\textbf{Exact values for hard scale for SIDIS:} The TMD hard coefficient function contains $\ln(|2q^+q^-|/\mu^2)$ which is usually approximated by $\ln(Q^2)$. Similarly, the $zeta$-scales are normalized as $\zeta \bar \zeta=(2q^+q^-)^2$, which is usually approximated by $Q^4$. So, the exact values of scales are
\begin{eqnarray}
\mu=\sqrt{Q^2-\vec q_T^2},\qquad \zeta_1=\zeta_2=Q^2-\vec q_T^2.
\end{eqnarray}
Traditionally, the corrections $\sim q_T/Q$ are dropped, since they are power corrections. Nonetheless, they could be included since they have different sources in comparison to power corrections to the factorized cross-section. Usage of one or another version of $scales$ is switched in \texttt{constants-file} (Option 10.A.p6).

The accounting of these corrections is switched on/off in \texttt{constants}. 

\subsection{Bin-integration routines}

The inclusion of bin-integration is essential for comparison with experiment. The integration over a bin is automatically included in the calculation of cross-section (although routines for unintegrated calculation are also presented). Typically, one does not need an extreme precision from such integration i.e. 4-5 digit precision is typically more then enough to reach the experimental precision. Also the cross-section is relatively slow-function (exception is Z-boson peak). Therefore, as a based method for bin-integration I have selected the adaptive Simpson integration rule. By default, the adaptive Simpson rule is used for integration over $z$, $x$, $Q^2$, and fixed-number-of-points Simpson method for $p_T$-integration. Note, one can switch to G7 method (faster but not presice) by modification of the pre-compile parameter in the beginning of the code.

The integration is made for phase-space element $dQ^2 dx d\vec p_\perp^2$. I.e.
\begin{eqnarray}
\Delta \sigma =\int dz \int dQ^2 dx d\vec p_\perp^2~ d\sigma
=\int_{z_{\min}}^{z_{\max}} dz\int_{Q_{\min}}^{Q_{\max}} 2Q~ dQ \int_{x_{\min}}^{x_{\max}} dx \int_{p_{\min}}^{p_{\max}} 2|\vec p_\perp|d|\vec p_\perp|~ d\sigma.
\end{eqnarray}
For processes with $dx\to dy$, or $dQ^2\to dy$ the integration is done in the same manner but with limits of integration over $Q$ or $x$ re-computed at values of $y$.

\textbf{Notes:} 
\begin{itemize}
\item If the limits of integration are inverted (i.e. $\int_a^b$ with $a>b$) the integral is set to zero. It is made intentionally, because the cuts may shift the limits upside-down, which corresponds to the completely-eliminated case.
\item The central value is computed at the mean of the bin. I.e. for bin $[a,b]$ the central value is computed at $(a+b)/2$.
\end{itemize}




\subsection{SIDIS theory}
\label{sec:SIDIS:theory}

In many aspects the theory for SIDIS is more complicated then for Drell-Yan. Here I collect the main definition which were used in the artemide. For a more detailed description see ref.\cite{Bacchetta:2006tn}. Note, that some parts of definition were derived by me, since I have not found them in the literature.

\subsubsection{Kinematics}

The process is
\begin{eqnarray}
H(P)+l(l)\to l(l')+h(p_h)+X,
\end{eqnarray}
with
\begin{eqnarray}
P^2=M^2, l^2=l'^2=m_l^2\simeq 0,\qquad p_h^2=m^2.
\end{eqnarray}
The standard variables used for the description of SIDIS are
\begin{eqnarray}
q=l-l' \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad Q^2=-q^2,\qquad x=\frac{Q^2}{2(Pq)},\qquad y=\frac{(Pq)}{(Pl)},\qquad z=\frac{(Pp_h)}{(Pq)}.
\end{eqnarray}
There are is also a set of power variables used to define power-corrections
\begin{eqnarray}
\gamma=\frac{2Mx}{Q},\qquad \rho=\frac{m}{zQ},\qquad \vec \rho_\perp^2=\frac{m^2+\vec p_\perp^2}{z^2Q^2}.
\end{eqnarray}

The variables $x$, $y$ and $Q^2$ are dependent: $xy(s-M^2)=Q^2$. The phase-volume $dxdQ^2$ can be expressed via $dxdy$ or $dydQ^2$:
\begin{eqnarray}
dxdQ^2= \frac{Q^2}{y}dxdy=\frac{x}{y}dydQ^2.
\end{eqnarray}
A phase space point is totally characterized by the following numbers:
\begin{eqnarray}
\{s,x,Q^2,z,\vec p_T^2\}.
\end{eqnarray}
Alternatively, one can replace $x\leftrightarrow Q^2 \leftrightarrow y$.

\subsubsection{Cross-section}

The cross-section for SIDIS has the general form
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{d\sigma}{dx dQ^2 dzd\psi d\phi_h d \vec p^2_{h\perp}}=\frac{\alpha_{\text{em}}^2(Q)}{Q^6}\frac{y^2}{8z}\frac{L_{\mu\nu}W^{\mu\nu}}{\sqrt{1+\vec \rho^2_\perp \gamma^2}},
\end{eqnarray}
where $L_{\mu\nu}$ is the lepton tensor, and $W_{\mu\nu}$ is the hadron tensor. The hadron tensor contains many term accompanied by polarization angles. 

The TMD factorization is performed in the factorization frame with respect to $\vec q_T^2\ll Q^2$. The factorization variable $|\vec q_T|$ is related to the measured variable $\vec p_{h\perp}$ as
\begin{eqnarray}
|\vec q_T|=\frac{|\vec p_{h\perp}|}{z}\sqrt{\frac{1+\gamma^2}{1-\gamma^2\rho^2}},\qquad \Leftrightarrow \qquad |\vec p_{h\perp}|=z |\vec q_T|\sqrt{\frac{1-\gamma^2\rho^2}{1+\gamma^2}}.
\end{eqnarray}
In the factorization frame, the unpolarized part of the hadron tensor 
\begin{eqnarray}
W^{\mu\nu}=\frac{-z_1g_T^{\mu\nu}}{\pi}\int |\vec b| d |\vec b| J_0(|\vec b| |\vec q_T|)\sum_f e_f^2 |C_V(-Q^2,\mu^2)|^2 F_1^f(x_1,\vec b)D_1^f(z_1,\vec b)+...~,
\end{eqnarray}
where dots denote, polarized terms, and power corrections. The LP variables $x_1$ and $z_1$ are
\begin{eqnarray}
x_1&=&-\frac{2x}{\gamma^2}\(1-\sqrt{1+\gamma^2\(1-\frac{\vec q_T^2}{Q^2}\)}\),
\\
z_1&=&-z\frac{1-\sqrt{1+\(1-\frac{\vec q_T^2}{Q^2}\)\gamma^2}}{\gamma^2}\frac{1+\sqrt{1-\rho^2 \gamma^2}}{1-\frac{\vec q_T^2}{Q^2}}.
\end{eqnarray}

Making the convolution with unpolarized leptonic tensor, we get the following expression for the cross-section
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{d\sigma}{dx dQ^2 dz d\vec p_{h\perp}^2}&=&2\pi\frac{\alpha^2_{\text{em}}}{Q^4}\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\vec \rho_{\perp}^2 \gamma^2}}\frac{y^2}{1-\varepsilon}
\frac{z_1}{z}\Bigg\{1+\(\varepsilon-\frac{\gamma^2}{2}\)\frac{\vec \rho^2_\perp-\rho^2}{1-\gamma^2\rho^2}\Bigg\}
\\\nn && \int \frac{|\vec b|d|\vec b|}{2} J_0\(\frac{|\vec b||\vec p_{h\perp}|}{z}\sqrt{\frac{1+\gamma^2}{1-\gamma^2 \rho^2}}\)\sum_f e_f^2|C_V(-\overline{Q}^2,\mu^2)|^2 F_1^f(x_1,\vec b)D_1^f(z_1,\vec b),
\end{eqnarray}
where 
\begin{eqnarray}
\varepsilon=\frac{1-y-\frac{\gamma^2y^2}{4}}{1-y+\frac{y^2}{2}+\frac{y^2 \gamma^2}{4}}.
\end{eqnarray}
The value $\overline{Q}^2=-2q^+q^-$, note that $\zeta\bar \zeta=\overline{Q}^4$. 

Clearly, this LP expression contains a set of power corrections. It is a standard problem of TMD factorization, where the limit of LP is not very standardly defined. Thus, there are options to switch off/on these corrections.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Transverse momentum corrections}: (option $p_1$ in section 10.C) Include terms proportional to $\vec \rho_\perp^2$.
\item \textbf{Target mass corrections}: (option $p_2$ in section 10.C) Include terms proportional to $\gamma^2$.
\item \textbf{Product mass corrections}: (option $p_3$ in section 10.C) Include terms proportional to $\rho^2$.
\item \textbf{Exact LP values of $x_1$ and $z_1$}: (option $p_4$ in section 10.C) Uses values of $x_1$ and $z_1$ (if option is \text{False} $x_1\to x$, $z_1\to z$)
\item \textbf{Exact LP value for factorization scale}: (option $p_5$ in section 10.C) Uses exact LP value for $\overline{Q}^2=-2q^+q^-=Q^2-\vec q_T^2$ (if option is \text{False} $\overline{Q}^2=Q^2$ )
\end{itemize}
Note, that corrections are included in the order from top to bottom. For example, terms $\sim \gamma^2 \rho^2=0$ if $p_2=$\texttt{F} and $p_3=$\texttt{T}.

\newpage

\section{KPC in TMD factorization}

The TMD factorization with KPCs is computed using different route. The primary problem is that one must compute these correction in the momentum space. It essentially complicates the computation, since the evolution is done in the position space. 

The module \texttt{TMDFint\_KPC\_DY} realizes the computation of the following integral
\begin{eqnarray}\label{KPC:main}
\mathcal{C}_{KPC}[K,FF]&=&4p_1^+p_2^+\int d\xi_1 d\xi_2 \int d^4k_1 d^4k_2 \delta^{(4)}(q-k_1-k_2)\delta(k_1^2)\delta(k_2^2)
\\ &&\delta(k_1^+-\xi_1 p_1^+)\delta(k_2^--\xi_2 p_2^-)K \times FF,
\end{eqnarray}
where $K$ is a kinematic kernel, that is resulted from the convolution of tensors, and $FF$ is the product of TMD distributions.

This function has the following interface
\begin{center}
\texttt{KPC\_DYconv(Q,qT,x1,x2,mu,proc1,proc2)}
\end{center}
where \texttt{Q,qT,x1,x2,mu} are usual variables, and \texttt{proc1} is (int,int,int)-array with first item being the number of $FF$, the second and third items being number of hadrons; \texttt{proc2} is the enumeration of factors K.

\subsection{Realization of convolution}

The integral for convolution can be presented as
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathcal{P} \mathcal{C}_{KPC}[K,FF]&=&\mathcal{P}
\int_{0}^{\pi/2}d\alpha \int_0^{\pi}d\theta  \frac{K \times FF }{2},
\end{eqnarray}
where 
\begin{eqnarray}
\xi_1&=&\frac{x_1}{2}\(1+S+\sqrt{\Lambda}\),
\\
\xi_2&=&\frac{x_2}{2}\(1-S+\sqrt{\Lambda}\),
\\
\vec k_1^2&=&\frac{\tau^2}{4}\(1-\Lambda+2S+S^2\),
\\
\vec k_2^2&=&\frac{\tau^2}{4}\(1-\Lambda-2S+S^2\),
\end{eqnarray}

\section{Equivalence between process-enumeration in ver.$<3$}

In the versions of artemide $<3$, the enumeration of processes was done with 3 integers $[\tilde a,\tilde b,\tilde c]$, where $\tilde a$ and $\tilde b$ determined the prefactor, and $\tilde c$ determined the actual process. In fact, first number was not used (extremely rarely), thus it was eliminated in version $>3$. Instead, the numeration of hadrons was added. In artemide $>3$ the process is enumerated by four integers $[b,c,h_1,h_2]$ where $b$ determines the prefactor, $c$ the type of process and $h_1$ and $h_2$ the hadrons for scattering.

The correspondence of process numbering is the following
\begin{itemize}
\item $\tilde a=1$, other options absent
\item $\tilde b=b$
\item $\tilde c$ is replaced by the $h_1$, $h_2$, $c$ according to the following table

\section{Theory}

\begin{center}
\red{\textbf{This section is under construction.}}
\end{center}

In this section, the details of theoretical input coded in \texttt{artemide} is given. This section does not pretend to be a comprehensive review of TMD factorization. Only superficial details and references to particular realizations are given. For detailed and accurate description of the theory see specialized literature.

\subsection{Definition of TMD distributions}

\red{TO BE WRITTEN}. In this section, there will be operator definition of TMD distributions, and details on way the perturbative matching and NP-medeling is realized in \texttt{artemide}.

\begin{eqnarray}
F_f(x,b)=\int_x^1 \frac{dz}{z}C_{f\ot f'}(z,b^*,c_4\mu_\text{OPE})f_{f'}(\frac{z}{x},c_4\mu_\text{OPE})f^f_{NP}(x,z,b,\{\lambda\}),
\end{eqnarray}
where $f_f(x,\mu)$ is PDF of flavor $f$, $C$ is the coefficient function in $\zeta$-prescription, $f_{NP}$ is the non-perturbative function. The variable $c_4$ is used to test the scale variation sensitivity of the TMD PDF. The NNLO coefficient functions used in the module were evaluated in \cite{Echevarria:2016scs} (please, cite it if use).

\begin{itemize}
\item Definition of TMD distributions, operators, Lorenz structures, coordinate and momentum space. 
\item Perturbative matching, and $\zeta$-prescription
\item NP-modeling
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Evolution of TMD distributions}

The detailed theory is given in the article \cite{Scimemi:2018xaf}. The NLO rapidity anomalous dimension has been evaluated in \cite{Echevarria:2015byo}. The NNLO rapidity anomalous dimension has been evaluated in \cite{Vladimirov:2016dll,Vladimirov:2017ksc}.

The evolution of TMD distribution of any kind is given by the following pair of equations
\begin{eqnarray}\label{def:TMD_ev_UV}
\mu^2 \frac{d}{d\mu^2} F_{f\ot h}(x,b;\mu,\zeta)&=&\frac{\gamma^f_F(\mu,\zeta)}{2}F_{f\ot h}(x,b;\mu,\zeta),
\\\label{def:TMD_ev_RAP}
\zeta\frac{d}{d\zeta}F_{f \ot h}(x,b;\mu,\zeta)&=& -\mathcal{D}^f(\mu,b)F_{f\ot h}(x,b;\mu,\zeta),
\end{eqnarray}
where $F_{f\ot h}$ is the TMD distribution (TMDPDF or TMDFF) of the parton $f$ in hadron $h$. The function $\gamma_F(\mu,\zeta)$ is called the TMD anomalous dimension and contains both single and double logarithms. The function $\mathcal{D}(\mu,b)$ is called the rapidity anomalous dimension. TMD and rapidity anomalous dimensions have not unified notation in the literature, for comparison of notation see table I in ref.\cite{Scimemi:2018xaf}. The only important quantum number for TMDs is the color representation the initiating parton, which is tied to the parton flavor, namely, quark (fundamental representation) or gluon (adjoint representation). However,  as the TMD evolution does not mix the flavors and  for simplicity of  notation, we omit the flavor index $f$ in this section, unless it is important. 

The uniqueness of solution for the coupled system (\ref{def:TMD_ev_UV})-(\ref{def:TMD_ev_RAP}) is guaranteed by \textit{the integrability condition}
\begin{eqnarray}\label{th:consitency}
\zeta \frac{d}{d\zeta}\gamma_F(\mu,\zeta)=-\mu \frac{d}{d\mu}\mathcal{D}(\mu,b),
\end{eqnarray} 
The mutual dependence can be worked out  explicitlydue to the fact that the ultraviolet divergences of the TMD operator partially overlap with the rapidity divergences, (see e.g.\cite{Collins:2011zzd,Vladimirov:2017ksc}), 
\begin{eqnarray}\label{th:dGammaF=G}
\zeta \frac{d}{d\zeta}\gamma_F(\mu,\zeta)=-\Gamma(\mu),
\\\label{th:dDD=G}
\mu \frac{d}{d\mu}\mathcal{D}(\mu,b)=\Gamma(\mu),
\end{eqnarray}
where $\Gamma$ is the (light-like) cusp anomalous dimension. The equation (\ref{th:dGammaF=G}) entirely fixes the logarithm dependence of the TMD anomalous dimension, which reads
\begin{eqnarray}\label{th:gammaV}
\gamma_F(\mu,\zeta)=\Gamma(\mu) \ln\(\frac{\mu^2}{\zeta}\)-\gamma_V(\mu).
\end{eqnarray}
The anomalous dimension $\gamma_V$ refers to the finite part of the renormalization of the vector form factor. In contrast, the equation (\ref{th:dDD=G}) cannot fix the logarithmic part of $\mathcal{D}$ entirely, but only order by order in  perturbation theory, because the parameter $\mu$ is also responsible for the running of the coupling constant.

The solution of eq.~(\ref{def:TMD_ev_UV})-(\ref{def:TMD_ev_RAP})  can be written as
\begin{eqnarray}\label{th:TMD_evol}
F(x,b;\mu_f,\zeta_f)=R[b;(\mu_f,\zeta_f)\to (\mu_i,\zeta_i)]F(x,b;\mu_i,\zeta_i),
\end{eqnarray}
where $R$ is the TMD evolution factor. The general form of the evolution factor is
\begin{eqnarray}\label{th:TMD_R}
R[b;(\mu_f,\zeta_f)\to (\mu_i,\zeta_i)]=\exp\[\int_P \(\gamma_F(\mu,\zeta)\frac{d\mu}{\mu} -\mathcal{D}(\mu,b)\frac{d\zeta}{\zeta}\)\] ,
\end{eqnarray}
where $(\mu_f,\zeta_f)$ and $(\mu_i,\zeta_i)$ refer respectively to a final  and initial set of scales. Here, the $\int_P$ denotes the line integral along the path $P$ in the $(\mu,\zeta)$-plane from the point $(\mu_f,\zeta_f)$ to the point $(\mu_i,\zeta_i)$. The integration can be done on an arbitrary path $P$, and the solution is independent on it, thanks to the integrability condition eq.~(\ref{th:consitency}). 

The TMD evolution factor $R$ obeys the transitivity relation
\begin{eqnarray}\label{th:transitivity}
R[b;(\mu_1,\zeta_1)\to (\mu_2,\zeta_2)]=R[b;(\mu_1,\zeta_1)\to (\mu_3,\zeta_3)]R[b;(\mu_3,\zeta_3)\to (\mu_2,\zeta_2)],
\end{eqnarray}
where $(\mu_3,\zeta_3)$ is arbitrary point in $(\mu,\zeta)$-plane and the  point inversion property
\begin{eqnarray}\label{th:inversion}
R[b;(\mu_1,\zeta_1)\to (\mu_2,\zeta_2)]=R^{-1}[b;(\mu_2,\zeta_2)\to (\mu_1,\zeta_1)].
\end{eqnarray}
These equations are the cornerstones of the evolution mechanism, since they allow an universal definition of the non-perturbative distributions and the comparison of different experiments. 

Different realizations of TMD evolution (if they are compatible with the factorization theorem) can be casted into selected of different paths of integration \red{ADD PICTURE}. All choices are equivalent, up to next-to-given order perturbative corrections, treatment of NP parts, and implementation of matching for TMD distributions. In \texttt{artemide} sevaral paths are presented, however, the matching of TMD distribution to collinear distributions is done in $\zeta$-prescription.

\subsubsection{Equipotential lines \& $\zeta$-prescription}

The $\zeta$-prescription is based on consideration of equipotential lines for evolution equations (\ref{def:TMD_ev_UV})-(\ref{def:TMD_ev_RAP}) (or lines of null-evolution, for description of evolution potential and its properties see \cite{Scimemi:2018xaf}). An equipotential line $\ell(b)=(\mu,\zeta)$ is determined by values of anomalous dimensions $\gamma_F$ and $\mathcal{D}$ at given $b$. The equation for line $\ell(b)$ can be written in the form $\zeta=\zeta(\mu,b)$. In this parameterization the for function $\zeta(\mu,b)$ is
\begin{eqnarray}\label{TMDR_th:3}
-\Gamma(\mu)\ln\(\frac{\zeta(\mu,b)}{\mu^2}\)-\gamma_V(\mu)=2\mathcal{D}(\mu,b)\frac{d\ln\zeta(\mu,b)}{d\ln\mu^2}.
\end{eqnarray}
Among set of equipotential lines there is a single special equipotential line, which passes thorough the saddle point of the evolution field. The saddle point $(\mu_{\text{saddle}},\zeta_{\text{saddle}})$ is defined by the equations
\begin{eqnarray}\label{TMDR_th:4}
\mathcal{D}(\mu_{\text{saddle}},b)=0,\qquad \gamma_V(\mu_{\text{saddle}},\zeta_{\text{saddle}})=0.
\end{eqnarray}
Note, that the value of $\mu_{\text{saddle}}$ depends on value of $b$, and on NP model for $\mathcal{D}$. In general it could be found only numerically. In typical models $\mu_{\text{saddle}}$ is decreasing monotonous function of $b$. At certain large values of $b$ it passes though the Landau pole, and its value could not be determined. This line we denote as
\begin{eqnarray}\label{TMDR_th:12}
\textbf{special equipotential line}=\zeta_\mu(b),\qquad (\mu_{\text{saddle}},\zeta_{\text{saddle}})\in \zeta_\mu(b).
\end{eqnarray}

By definition a TMD distribution is the same for all points of equipotential line. In particular it means that there is no dependence on variable $\mu$, since a variation of $\mu$ is compensated by appropriate variation in $\zeta(\mu)$. 

\textbf{Important note:} The presence of NP part in $\mathcal{D}$ makes determination of special line involved. We distinguish three ``realizations'' of the special line. The exact which is determined by equation (\ref{TMDR_th:3}) and boundary conditions (\ref{TMDR_th:12}) (its values can be calculated by function \texttt{zetaSL}). The perturbative realization where NP part is dropped (its values can be calculated by functions \texttt{zetaMUperp} and \texttt{zetaMUresum}). And user-defined which is given by user in \texttt{TMDR\_model.f90} file.

\subsubsection{Exact solution for evolution to special line}

There is a possibility to define the evolution to the optimal equipotential line in perturbation theory for any NP input, at any $b$. Instead of problematic variable $b$ one uses the function $\mathcal{D}(\mu,b)$ as a variable. With the ansatz $\zeta_\mu=\mu^2 \exp(-g(\mu,b))$ we rewrite equation (\ref{TMDR_th:3}) as
\begin{eqnarray}
2\mathcal{D}(\mu,b)\(1-\frac{dg(\mu,b)}{d\ln \mu^2}\)-\Gamma(\mu)g(\mu,b)+\gamma_V(\mu)=0.
\end{eqnarray}
or
\begin{eqnarray}\label{TMDR_th:16}
2\mathcal{D}\(1-\frac{\partial g(\mu,\mathcal{D})}{\partial \ln \mu^2}-\frac{\Gamma(\mu)}{2}g'(\mu,\mathcal{D})\)-\Gamma(\mu)g(\mu,\mathcal{D})+\gamma_V(\mu)=0,
\end{eqnarray}
where $g'=d g/d\mathcal{D}$. The boundary condition (\ref{TMDR_th:4}) is transformed to the condition that $g$ is regular at $\mathcal{D}\to 0$. Note, that this condition does not depends on $b$ and thus determines the function unambiguously at any $b$, even if saddle point is behind the Landau-pole values. 

The equation (\ref{TMDR_th:16}) is simplified further with introduction of new function $\tilde g(a_s,\mathcal{D})=\mathcal{D} g(\mu,\mathcal{D})$:
\begin{eqnarray}\label{TMDR_th:17}
2\mathcal{D}+2\beta(a_s)\frac{\partial \tilde g(a_s,\mathcal{D})}{\partial a_s}-\Gamma(a_s)\tilde g'(a_s,\mathcal{D})+\gamma_V(a_s)=0,
\end{eqnarray}
with boundary condition $\tilde g(a_s,0)=0$. The general solution reads
\begin{eqnarray}
\tilde g(a_s,\mathcal{D})=-\frac{\mathcal{D}}{2}\int^{a_s} \frac{da}{\beta(a)}-\int^{a_s} da \frac{\gamma_V(a)}{2\beta(a)}
-\int^{a_s} da \frac{\Gamma(a)}{2\beta(a)}\int^a\frac{da'}{\beta(a')}+\Phi\(\mathcal{D}+\int^{a_s} da \frac{\Gamma(a)}{2\beta(a)}\),
\end{eqnarray}
where $\Phi$ is a solution of the following transcendental equation
\begin{eqnarray}
\Phi\(\int^{a_s} da \frac{\Gamma(a)}{2\beta(a)}\)=\int^{a_s} da \frac{\gamma_V(a)}{2\beta(a)}
+\int^{a_s} da \frac{\Gamma(a)}{2\beta(a)}\int^a\frac{da'}{\beta(a')}.
\end{eqnarray}
Unfortunately, this equation is practically impossible to solve for higher then NNLL anomalous dimensions. It is straightforward to show that at large-$\mathcal{D}$ the solution is
\begin{eqnarray}
\tilde g(a_s,\mathcal{D}\to \infty)=\mathcal{D}\int^{a_s}\frac{-1}{\beta(a)}da+...~.
\end{eqnarray}
Note that asymptotic is defined up to a constant.


The function $g$ is convenient to derive as perturbative expansion
\begin{eqnarray}\label{TMDR_th:20}
g(\mu,\mathcal{D})=\frac{1}{a_s(\mu)}\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_s^n(\mu) g_n(\mathcal{D}).
\end{eqnarray}
We have found
\begin{eqnarray}
g_0&=&\frac{e^{-p}+p-1}{\beta_0 p},
\\
g_1&=&g_0\(\frac{\beta_1}{\beta_0}-\frac{\Gamma_1}{\Gamma_0}\)+\frac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_0}-\frac{\beta_1}{2\beta_0^2}p,
\\
g_2&=&g_0\frac{\beta_2\Gamma_0-\beta_1\Gamma_1}{\beta_0\Gamma_0}+\frac{\ch p-1}{p}\frac{\beta_0\Gamma_1^2-\beta_0\Gamma_0\Gamma_2+\beta_1\Gamma_0\Gamma_1-\beta_2\Gamma_0}{\beta_0^2\Gamma_0^2}+\frac{e^p-1}{p}\frac{\Gamma_0\gamma_2-\Gamma_1\gamma_1}{\Gamma_0^2},
\end{eqnarray}
where $p=2\beta_0 \mathcal{D}/\Gamma_0$. 

There is an additional problem that appears at NNNLO, namely, the coefficient $g_3$ is negative. It results to a singular solution for  $\zeta_\mu$ at large-$\mathcal{D}$. It indicates that the series has bad convergence properties. This problems occur for very large $\mathcal{D}>0.9 - 1.1$. Currently to by-pass this problem the 4-loop exact $\zeta$-line is not used (3-loop expression is used instead). For small-$\mathcal{D}$ the difference is negligible.

The solution for the evolution from $(\mu,\zeta)\to(\mu,\zeta_\mu)$ is
\begin{eqnarray}
R[b;(\mu,\zeta)\to(\mu,\zeta_\mu)]=\exp\(-\mathcal{D}(\mu)\ln\(\frac{\zeta}{\mu^2}\)-\mathcal{D}(\mu,b)g(\mu,\mathcal{D})\).
\end{eqnarray}


\subsection{Expressions for evolution functions in \texttt{artemide}}

Here are the expression for various evolution functions how they are written in \texttt{artemide} in \texttt{TMDR}-module.

\subsubsection{Fixed order RAD:}
\begin{tcolorbox}
\texttt{Dpert(mu,bT,f)}: ~~~returns $\mathcal{D}^f(b,\mu)$ [real(dp)]
\\
\texttt{mu, bT} [real(dp)] scales in GeV, \texttt{f}[integer] flavour. 
\\
Order is controlled by \texttt{orderD} ($=n_{\text{max}}$). At \texttt{orderD}=0, \texttt{Dpert}=0.
\end{tcolorbox}

Solving (\ref{th:dDD=G}) we get
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathcal{D}(b,\mu)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_s^n \sum_{k=0}^n \mathbf{L}_\mu^k d^{(n,k)},
\end{eqnarray}
where $d^{(n,0)}$ are obtained by calculation. The coefficients $d^{(n,k)}$ are
\begin{eqnarray*}
d^{(1,1)}&=&\frac{\Gamma_0}{2},
\\
d^{(2,2)}&=&\frac{\Gamma_0\beta_0}{4},
\\
d^{(2,1)}&=&\frac{\Gamma_1}{2},
\\
d^{(3,3)}&=&\frac{\Gamma_0\beta_0^2}{6},
\\
d^{(3,2)}&=&\frac{\Gamma_0\beta_1+2\Gamma_1\beta_0}{4},
\\
d^{(3,1)}&=&\frac{\Gamma_2+4\beta_0 d^{(2,0)}}{2},
\end{eqnarray*}
where flavor on both sides is the same.

\subsubsection{Resummed RAD:}
\begin{tcolorbox}
\texttt{Dresum(mu,bT,f)}: ~~~returns $\mathcal{D}_{\text{resum}}^f(b,\mu)$ [real(dp)]
\\
\texttt{mu, bT} [real(dp)] scales in GeV, \texttt{f}[integer] flavour. 
\\
Order is controlled by \texttt{orderDresum} ($=n_{\text{max}}$). At \texttt{orderDresum}=0, \texttt{Dresum}=$-\frac{\Gamma_0}{2\beta_0}\ln(1-X)$.
\end{tcolorbox}

One can resumm the logarithms in this expression and write it as
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathcal{D}_{\text{resum}}=-\frac{\Gamma_0}{2\beta_0}\Big[\ln(1-X)+\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{a_s^n}{(1-X)^n}\sum_{k,l=0}^n X^k \ln^l(1-X)d_r^{(n,k,l)}\Big],\qquad X=\beta_0 a_s \mathbf{L}_\mu,
\end{eqnarray}
the coefficients $d_r$ are 
\begin{eqnarray*}
d_r^{(1,0,1)}&=&B_1,\qquad d_r^{(1,1,0)}=B_1-G_1,\qquad d_r^{(1,0,0)}=0,
\\
d_r^{(2,0,2)}&=&-\frac{B^2_1}{2},\qquad d_r^{(2,0,1)}=B_1G_1,
\\
d_r^{(2,2,0)}&=&\frac{1}{2}\(G_2-B_1G_1-B_2+B_1^2\)
\qquad
d_r^{(2,1,0)}=B_1G_1-G_2,
\\
d_r^{(2,0,0)}&=&-2\frac{d^{(2,0)}\beta_0}{\Gamma_0},\qquad d_r^{(2,2,2)}=d_r^{(2,1,1)}=0,
\end{eqnarray*}
\begin{eqnarray*}
d_r^{(3,0,3)}&=&\frac{B_1^3}{3},\qquad d_r^{(3,0,2)}=-\frac{B_1^3}{2}-B_1^2G_1,
\qquad d_r^{(3,0,1)}=B_1G_2+4\frac{d^{(2,0)}\beta_1}{\Gamma_0},
\\
d_r^{(3,1,1)}&=&B_1B_2-B_1^3,\qquad \text{ other }d^{(3,k>0,l>0)}_r=0,
\\
d_r^{(3,3,0)}&=&\frac{1}{3}\(B_1^3-2B_1B_2+B_3-B_1^2G_1+B_2G_1+B_1G_2-G_3\),
\\
d_r^{(3,2,0)}&=&-\frac{1}{2}B_1^3+B_1B_2-\frac{B_3}{2}+B_1^2G_1-B_2G_1-B_1G_2+G_3,
\\
d_r^{(3,1,0)}&=&B_1G_2-G_3,\qquad d_r^{(3,0,0)}=-2\frac{d^{(3,0)}\beta_0}{\Gamma_0}
\end{eqnarray*}
Here,
$$G_i=\frac{\Gamma_i}{\Gamma_0},\qquad B_i=\frac{\beta_i}{\beta_0}$$

\subsubsection{Fixed order $\zeta$-line:}
\begin{tcolorbox}
\texttt{zetaMUpert(mu,bT,f)}: ~~~returns $\zeta^f(b,\mu)$ [real(dp)]
\\
\texttt{mu, bT} [real(dp)] scales in GeV, \texttt{f}[integer] flavour. 
\\
Order is controlled by \texttt{orderZETA} ($=n_{\text{max}}$). At \texttt{orderZETA}<0, \texttt{zetaMUpert}=1.
\end{tcolorbox}

The solution of (\ref{TMDR_th:3}) in PT can be written as
\begin{eqnarray}
\zeta^f(b,\mu)=\frac{C_0 \mu}{b}e^{-v},\qquad v=\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_s^n \sum_{k=0}^{n+1}\mathbf{L}_\mu v^{(n,k)}.
\end{eqnarray}
The \textit{perturbative boundary condition} is that $v$ is regular at $\mathbf{L}\to0$. The first coefficients are 
\begin{eqnarray*}
&& v^{(0,0)}=g_1,\qquad v^{(0,1)}=0,
\\
&& v^{(1,2)}=\frac{\beta_0}{12},\qquad v^{(1,1)}=0,\qquad v^{(1,0)}=\mathbf{d}^{(2,0)}-g_1G_1+g_2,
\\
&& v^{(2,3)}=\frac{\beta_0^2}{24},\qquad v^{(2,2)}=\frac{\beta_0}{12}\(B_1+G_1\),\qquad v^{(2,1)}=\frac{\beta_0}{2}\(\frac{8}{3}\mathbf{d}^{(2,0)}-g_1G_1+g_2\),
\\
&& v^{(2,0)}=\mathbf{d}^{(3,0)}-\mathbf{d}^{(2,0)}G_1+g_1G_1^2-g_2G_1-g_1G_2+g_3,
\end{eqnarray*}
here
$$
\mathbf{d}^{(n,k)}=\frac{d^{(n,k)}}{\Gamma_0},\qquad g_i=\frac{\gamma_V^{(i)}}{\Gamma_0},\qquad G_i=\frac{\Gamma_i}{\Gamma_0},\qquad B_i=\frac{\beta_i}{\beta_0}.
$$

\subsubsection{Resummed $\zeta$-line:}
\begin{tcolorbox}
\texttt{zetaMUresum(mu,bT,f)}: ~~~returns $\zeta_{\text{resum}}^f(b,\mu)$ [real(dp)]
\\
\texttt{mu, bT} [real(dp)] scales in GeV, \texttt{f}[integer] flavour. 
\\
Order is controlled by \texttt{orderZETA}.
\\
\textbf{\red{REMOVED in v.2.03. TO BE REINTRODUCED LATER.}}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection{Exact $\zeta$-line:}
\begin{tcolorbox}
\texttt{zetaSL(mu,bT,f)}: ~~~returns $\zeta_{\text{exact}}^f(b,\mu)$ [real(dp)]
\\
\texttt{mu, bT} [real(dp)] scales in GeV, \texttt{f}[integer] flavour. 
\\
Order is controlled by \texttt{orderZETA}. At \texttt{orderZETA}<0, \texttt{zetaMUpert}=1.
\\
\textbf{\red{Currently at the order =3, the result is NNLO. Due to instability of N$^3$LO at very large $\mathcal{D}$.}}
\end{tcolorbox}

The solution for $\zeta$ can be written as
\begin{eqnarray}
\zeta(b,\mu)=\mu^2 \exp\(-g(a_s,\mathcal{D})\).
\end{eqnarray}
The function $g$ is convinient to present as
\begin{eqnarray}
g(a_s,\mathcal{D})=\frac{\Omega(a_s,p)}{a_s\beta_0},\qquad p=\frac{2\beta_0 \mathcal{D}}{\Gamma_0},
\end{eqnarray}
where $\Omega$ is convenient to present in the following form
\begin{eqnarray}
\Omega(a_s,p)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_s^n \Omega_n(p),
\end{eqnarray}
with
\begin{eqnarray*}
&&\Omega_0=z_1,\qquad \Omega_1=(B_1-G_1)z_1+g_1-\frac{B_1}{2}p,
\\
&& 
\Omega_2=\frac{B_2-B_1G_1+G_1^2-G_2}{2}z_1+\frac{-B_2+B_1G_1+G_1^2-G_2-2G_1g_1+2g_2}{2}z_{-1}+g_2-g_1G_1
\\
&&
\Omega_3=\frac{2B_3+B_1^2G_1-B_2G_1-G_1^3+3 G_1G_2-B_1B_2-B_1G_2-2G_3}{6}z_1
\\&&
+\frac{G_1-B_1}{2}\(-B_2+B_1G_1+G_1^2-G_2-2G_1g_1+2g_2\)z_{-1}
\\&&
\Big[\frac{-B_3+B_1^2G_1+2B_2G_1-4G_1^3+6G_1G_2-B_1B_2+B_1G_2-2G_3}{12}+(2G_1-B_1)\frac{G_1g_1-g_2}{2}-\frac{G_2g_1-g_3}{2}\Big]z_{-2}
\\&&
+G_1^2g_1-G_2g_1-G_1g_2+g_3.
\end{eqnarray*}
Here
\begin{eqnarray}
B_i=\frac{\beta_i}{\beta_0},\qquad G_i=\frac{\Gamma_i}{\Gamma_0},\qquad g_i=\gamma^{(i)}\frac{\beta_0}{\Gamma_0},\qquad z_n=\frac{e^{-n p}-1+n p}{p}.
\end{eqnarray}
Note that  $\lim_{p\to 0}z_n\sim n^2 p/2$.

\section{Harpy}

The \texttt{harpy} (from combination of \blue{H}ybrid \blue{AR}temide+\blue{PY}thon)) is an interface to \texttt{artemide} to the python.

It is directly possible to interfacing the \texttt{artemide} to python since \texttt{artemide} is made on fortran95. It uses some of it features, such as interfaces, and indirect list declarations, which are alien to python. Also I have not found any convenient way to include several dependent Fortran modules in f2py (if you have suggestion just tell me). Therefore, I made a wrap module \texttt{harpy.f90} that call some useful functions from \texttt{artemide} with simple declarations. So, it could be linked to python by f2py library.

So, in the current realization I create the signature file that declare python module artemide, which has an wrap module harpy. In python it looks like

$>>>$ import artemide

$>>>$ artemide.harpy.initialize("NNLO")

$>>>$ print artemide.harpy.utmdpdf\_5\_optimal(0.1,1.,1)

Ugly, but it works.

Note, that not all functions of \texttt{artemide} are available in \texttt{harpy}. I have added only the most useful, however, you can add them by our-self, or write me an e-mail. Here, list the functions from \texttt{artemide} and their synonym in \texttt{harpy}
